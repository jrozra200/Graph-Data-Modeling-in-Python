It is not clear whether these patients would benefit from antifungal treatment . We sought to determine whether a 3-month course of voriconazole improved asthma-related outcomes in patients with asthma who are IgE sensitized to A fumigatus . Asthmatic patients who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus with a history of at least 2 severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months were treated for 3 months with 200 mg of voriconazole twice daily , followed by observation for 9 months , in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized design . Primary outcomes were improvement in quality of life at the end of the treatment period and a reduction in the number of severe exacerbations over the 12 months of the study . Sixty-five patients were randomized . Fifty-nine patients started treatment ( 32 receiving voriconazole and 27 receiving placebo ) and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis . Fifty-six patients took the full 3 months of medication . Between the voriconazole and placebo groups , there were no significant differences in the number of severe exacerbations ( 1.16 vs 1.41 per patient per year , respectively ; mean difference , 0.25 ; 95 % CI , 0.19-0 .31 ) , quality of life ( change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score , 0.68 vs 0.88 ; mean difference between groups , 0.2 ; 95 % CI , -0.05 to -0.11 ) , or any of our secondary outcome measures . We were unable to show a beneficial effect of 3 months of treatment with voriconazole in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus on either the rate of severe exacerbations , quality of life , or other markers of asthma control .',\n",
       " ' Opioid antagonists ( e.g. , naltrexone ) and positive modulators of - aminobutyric-acidA ( GABAA ) receptors ( e.g. , alprazolam ) modestly attenuate the abuse-related effects of stimulants like amphetamine . The use of higher doses to achieve greater efficacy is precluded by side effects . Combining naltrexone and alprazolam might safely maximize efficacy while avoiding the untoward effects of the constituent compounds . The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone . Eight nontreatment-seeking , stimulant-using individuals completed an outpatient experiment in which oral d-amphetamine ( 0 , 15 , and 30 mg ) was administered following acute pretreatment with naltrexone ( 0 and 50 mg ) and alprazolam ( 0 and 0.5 mg ) . Subjective effects , psychomotor task performance , and physiological measures were collected . Oral d-amphetamine produced prototypical physiological and stimulant-like positive subjective effects ( e.g. , VAS ratings of Active/Alert/Energetic , Good Effect , and High ) . Pretreatment with naltrexone , alprazolam , and their combination did not produce clinically problematic acute physiological effects or negative subjective effects . Naltrexone and alprazolam each significantly attenuated some of the subjective effects of d-amphetamine . The combination attenuated a greater number of subjective effects than the constituent drugs alone . The present results support the continued evaluation of an opioid receptor antagonist combined with a GABAA-positive modulator using more clinically relevant experimental conditions like examining the effect of chronic dosing with these drugs on methamphetamine self-administration .',\n",
       " ' The sequencing of learning materials greatly influences the knowledge that learners construct . Recently , learning theorists have focused on the sequencing of instruction in relation to solving related problems . The general consensus suggests explicit instruction should be provided ; however , when to provide instruction remains unclear . We tested the impact of conceptual instruction preceding or following mathematics problem solving to determine when conceptual instruction should or should not be delayed . We also examined the learning processes supported to inform theories of learning more broadly . We worked with 122 second - and third-grade children . In a randomized experiment , children received instruction on the concept of math equivalence either before or after being asked to solve and explain challenging equivalence problems with feedback . Providing conceptual instruction first resulted in greater procedural knowledge and conceptual knowledge of equation structures than delaying instruction until after problem solving . Prior conceptual instruction enhanced problem solving by increasing the quality of explanations and attempted procedures . Providing conceptual instruction prior to problem solving was the more effective sequencing of activities than the reverse . We compare these results with previous , contrasting findings to outline a potential framework for understanding when instruction should or should not be delayed .',\n",
       " \" Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care . `` No-show '' appointments contribute to suboptimal resource use . Patient navigation and telephone reminders have been shown to improve cancer care and adherence , particularly in disadvantaged populations , but may not be cost-effective if not targeted at the appropriate patients . In 5 clinics within a large academic cancer center , patients who were considered to be likely ( the top 20th percentile ) to miss a scheduled appointment without contacting the clinic ahead of time ( `` no-shows '' ) were identified using a predictive model and then randomized to an intervention versus a usual-care group . The intervention group received telephone calls from a bilingual patient navigator 7 days before and 1 day before the appointment . Over a 5-month period , of the 40,075 appointments scheduled , 4425 patient appointments were deemed to be at high risk of a `` no-show '' event . After the patient navigation intervention , the no-show rate in the intervention group was 10.2 % ( 167 of 1631 ) , compared with 17.5 % in the control group ( 280 of 1603 ) ( P < .001 ) . Reaching a patient or family member was associated with a significantly lower no-show rate ( 5.9 % and 3.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 and .006 , respectively ) compared with leaving a message ( 14.7 % : P = .117 ) or no contact ( no-show rate , 21.6 % : P = .857 ) . Telephone navigation targeted at those patients predicted to be at high risk of visit nonadherence was found to effectively and substantially improve patient adherence to cancer clinic appointments . Further studies are needed to determine the long-term impact on patient outcomes , but short-term gains in the optimization of resources can be recognized immediately .\",\n",

       " ' To estimate age at attaining Tanner stages in Ugandan/Zimbabwean HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in older childhood and investigate predictors of delayed puberty , particularly age at ART initiation . Observational analysis within a randomized trial . Tanner staging was assessed every 24 weeks from 10 years of age , menarche every 12 weeks and height every 4-6 weeks . Age at attaining different Tanner stages was estimated using normal interval regression , considering predictors using multivariable regression . Growth was estimated using multilevel models with child-specific intercepts and trajectories . Median age at ART initiation was 9.4 years ( inter-quartile range 7.8 , 11.3 ) ( n = 582 ) . At the first assessment , the majority ( 80.2 % ) were in Tanner stage 1 ; median follow-up with staging was 2.8 years . There was a strong delaying effect of older age at ART initiation on age at attaining all Tanner stages ( P < 0.05 ) and menarche ( P = 0.02 ) ; in boys the delaying effect generally weakened with older age . There were additional significant delays associated with greater impairments in pre-ART height-for-age Z-score ( P < 0.05 ) in both sexes and pre-ART BMI-for-age in girls ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no evidence that pre-ART immuno-suppression independently delayed puberty or menarche . However , older children/adolescents had significant growth spurts in intermediate Tanner stages , and were still significantly increasing their height when in Tanner stage 5 ( P < 0.01 ) . Delaying ART initiation until older childhood substantially delays pubertal development and menarche , independently of immuno-suppression . This highlights that factors other than CD4 , such as pubertal development , need consideration when making decisions about timing of ART initiation in older children .',\n",
       " ' To assess the effects of a patient oriented decision aid for prioritising treatment goals in diabetes compared with usual care on patient empowerment and treatment decisions . Pragmatic randomised controlled trial . 18 general practices in the north of the Netherlands . 344 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years at the time of diagnosis and managed in primary care between April 2011 and August 2012 : 225 were allocated to the intervention group and 119 to the usual care group . The intervention comprised a decision aid for people with diabetes , with individually tailored risk information and treatment options for multiple risk factors . The aid was intended to empower patients to prioritise between clinical domains and to support treatment decisions . It was offered to participants before a regular diabetes check-up and to their healthcare provider during the consultation . Four different formats of the decision aid were included for additional explorative analyses . The primary outcome was the effects on patient empowerment for setting and achieving goals . The secondary outcomes were changes in the prescribing of drugs to regulate glucose , blood pressure , lipids , and albuminuria . Data were collected through structured questionnaires and automated data extraction from electronic health records during six months before and after the intervention . Of all intervention participants , 103 ( 46 % ) reported to have received the basic elements of the intervention . For the primary outcome analysis , 199 intervention and 107 control patients with sufficient baseline and follow-up data could be included . The mean empowerment score increased 0.1 on a 5 point scale in the overall intervention group , which was not significantly different from that of the control group ( mean difference after adjusting for baseline 0.039 , 95 % confidence interval -0.056 to 0.134 ) .

There was no statistically significant difference in TDP in 127 men treated with bicalutamide/dutasteride ( n = 62 ) compared with bicalutamide/placebo ( n = 65 ) ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.94 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.61 , 1.46 ] ; p = 0.79 ) . The estimated median TDP was 425 days ( 95 % CI 302 , 858 ) in the bicalutamide/placebo group and 623 days ( 95 % CI 369 , 730 ) in the bicalutamide/dutasteride group . There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for any secondary efficacy end-points , including time to treatment failure or PSA response . In the multivariate analysis , age , non-White race , higher baseline testosterone and lower baseline PSA were associated with longer TDP . Adverse events were comparable between treatment groups . In men with non-metastatic CRPC , adding dutasteride to bicalutamide did not significantly prolong TDP . Prospective data are provided concerning the common practice of using bicalutamide in this setting .\",\n",
       " \" Menopause is the stage when the menstrual period permanently stops , and is a part of every woman 's life . It usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 years , and is associated with hormonal , physical , and psychological changes . Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause . In this stage , the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone . When the body produces less of these hormones , the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women . This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women . A community-based interventional study was conducted in selected areas in Kattankulathur Block , Kanchipuram District , Tamil Nadu , India . A simple random sampling technique was used to select menopausal women for the study . Of 260 menopausal women identified , 130 were allocated to a study group and 130 to a control group . The study group underwent yoga training for 1.5 hours per day on 5 consecutive days . After the 5-day intensive yoga training program , the menopausal women practiced yoga daily at home for 35-40 minutes a day . Along with daily yoga practice , they underwent group yoga practice for 2 days a week under the supervision of one of the investigators until 18 weeks . The yoga training program consisted of Yogasanas , Pranayama ( breathing exercises ) , and meditation . The standardized World Health Organization QoL BREF scale was used to assess the women 's quality of life . We distributed an instruction manual on steps of selected yoga practice for the women 's self-reference at home after the 5 days of continuous yoga practice . A yoga practice diary was used to confirm regular performance of yoga . The women in the control group did not participate in the yoga program ; however , on completion of the study , these women received intensive yoga training for 5 days . There was an extremely high statistically significant difference ( P = 0.001 ) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life after 6 , 12 , and 18 weeks of yoga therapy . The mean gain score was high in all the domains of quality of life in the study group at weeks 6 , 12 , and 18 . The overall mean gain score in the study group was 31.58 versus 1.61 in the control group . The overall mean gain score difference was 29.97 in all domains of quality of life between the study group and the control group . In the study group , the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life were greatly improved by practicing yoga for 18 weeks . No adverse events were reported by the women after yoga practice . Quality of life in menopausal women was greatly improved after 18 weeks of yoga practice . Women who regularly practice yoga find that they are able to enjoy menopause and experience the freedom , liberation , and energy that it brings . We conclude that yoga is an effective complementary health approach for improving quality of life in menopausal women .\",\n",
       " ' Constipation has a significant impact on quality of life . Aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and the efficacy for relieving dyschezia symptoms of a CO2-releasing suppository in a randomized , placebo-controlled , clinical trial . Fifty-three office-based primary care physicians and 24 gastroenterologists conducted the study in France , between November 2010 and January 2012 . Patients ( aged 18-75 years ) with dyschezia were eligible . Patients were randomly allocated a once-a-day suppository ( CO2-releasing suppository or placebo ) for 21 days . Primary endpoint was the change , from Day 0 to Day 21 , in the intensity of discomfort related to dyschezia based on a self-assessed 0-100 visual analogue scale . A total of 323 patients were randomized , i.e. 166 into the intervention group and 157 into the placebo group . Co-variance analysis showed a greater reduction in discomfort visual analogue scale score in the intervention group ( -34.5 mm ; standard error of the mean : 1.8 mm ) than in the placebo group ( -26.2 mm ; standard error of the mean : 1.9 mm ; p < 0.001 ) . The greater efficacy of the CO2-releasing suppository was confirmed for all secondary efficacy parameters . No significant side effects for either treatment were observed . A CO2-releasing suppository is more effective than a placebo for the relief of symptoms of dyschezia . This efficacy is associated with a good safety profile .',\n",
       " ' Tubal ectopic pregnancy can be surgically treated by salpingectomy , in which the affected Fallopian tube is removed , or salpingotomy , in which the tube is preserved . Despite potentially increased risks of persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy , salpingotomy is often preferred over salpingectomy because the preservation of both tubes is assumed to offer favourable fertility prospects , although little evidence exists to support this assumption . We aimed to assess whether salpingotomy would improve rates of ongoing pregnancy by natural conception compared with salpingectomy . In this open-label , multicentre , international , randomised controlled trial , women aged 18 years and older with a laparoscopically confirmed tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube were randomly assigned via a central internet-based randomisation program to receive salpingotomy or salpingectomy . The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy by natural conception . Differences in cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates were expressed as a fecundity rate ratio with 95 % CI , calculated by Cox proportional-hazards analysis with a time horizon of 36 months . Secondary outcomes were persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy ( expressed as relative risks [ RRs ] with 95 % CIs ) and ongoing pregnancy after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF . The researchers who collected data for fertility outcomes were masked to the assigned intervention , but patients and the investigators who analysed the data were not . All endpoints were analysed by intention to treat . We also did a ( non-prespecified ) meta-analysis that included the findings from the present trial . This trial is registered , number ISRCTN37002267 . 446 women were randomly assigned between Sept 24 , 2004 , and Nov 29 , 2011 , with 215 allocated to salpingotomy and 231 to salpingectomy . Follow-up was discontinued on Feb 1 , 2013 . The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate was 607 % after salpingotomy and 562 % after salpingectomy ( fecundity rate ratio 106 , 95 % CI 081-138 ; log-rank p = 0678 ) . Persistent trophoblast occurred more frequently in the salpingotomy group than in the salpingectomy group ( 14 [ 7 % ] vs 1 [ < 1 % ] ; RR 150 , 20-1134 ) . Repeat ectopic pregnancy occurred in 18 women ( 8 % ) in the salpingotomy group and 12 ( 5 % ) women in the salpingectomy group ( RR 16 , 08-33 ) . The number of ongoing pregnancies after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF did not differ significantly between the groups . 43 ( 20 % ) women in the salpingotomy group were converted to salpingectomy during the initial surgery because of persistent tubal bleeding . Our meta-analysis , which included our own results and those of one other study , substantiated the results of the trial . In women with a tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube , salpingotomy does not significantly improve fertility prospects compared with salpingectomy .

       " ' To examine the diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarkers of myocardial injury and troponin assays for diagnosis of myocardial infarction . 850 patients randomised to the point-of-care testing arm of the Randomised Assessment of Panel Assay of Cardiac markers ( RATPAC ) study in six emergency departments of low-risk patients presenting with chest pain were studied . Blood samples were obtained on admission and 90 min from admission . Myocardial infarction was defined by the universal definition of myocardial infarction . The following diagnostic strategies were compared by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and comparison of area under the curve : individual marker values and the combination of presentation heart fatty acid binding protein ( HFABP ) and copeptin with troponin . 68 patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction . Admission samples were available from 838/1132 patients enrolled in the study . Areas under the curve were as follows ( CIs in parentheses ) : cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) Stratus CS 0.94 ( 0.90 to 0.98 ) , cTnI Beckmann 0.92 ( 0.88 to 0.96 ) , cTnI Siemens ultra 0.90 ( 0.85 to 0.95 ) , cardiac troponin T high sensitivity 0.92 ( 0.88 to 0.96 ) , HFABP 1 0.84 ( 0.77 to 0.90 ) copeptin 0.62 ( 0.57 to 0.68 ) . HFABP and copeptin were diagnostically inferior to troponin . The combination of HFABP ( at the 95th percentile ) and troponin ( at the 99th percentile ) increased diagnostic sensitivity . High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the best single marker . Addition of HFABP to high-sensitivity troponin increased diagnostic sensitivity . Additional measurement of copeptin is not useful in the chest pain population .',\n",
       " ' Multidimensional tinnitus models describe dysfunctional cognitions as a complicating factor in the process of tinnitus habituation . However , this concept has rarely been investigated in previous research . The present study investigated the effects of two cognitive-behavioral treatments on dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions in patients with chronic tinnitus . Furthermore , dysfunctional cognitions were examined as possible predictors of the therapeutic effect on tinnitus distress . A total of 128 patients with chronic tinnitus were randomly assigned to either an Internet-delivered guided self-help treatment ( Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy , ICBT ) , a conventional face-to-face group therapy ( cognitive-behavioral group therapy , GCBT ) , or an active control group in the form of a web-based discussion forum ( DF ) . To assess tinnitus-related dysfunctional thoughts , the Tinnitus Cognitions Scale ( T-Cog ) was used at pre - and post-assessment , as well as at the 6 - and 12-month follow-up . Multivariate ANOVAs with post hoc tests revealed significant and comparable reductions of dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions for both treatments ( GCBT and ICBT ) , which remained stable over a 6 - and 12-month period . Negative correlations were found between the catastrophic subscale of the T-Cog and therapy outcome for ICBT , but not for GCBT . This means a higher degree of catastrophic thinking at baseline was associated with lower benefit from ICBT directly after the treatment . Hierarchical regression analysis confirmed catastrophizing as a predictor of poorer therapy outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT . No associations were detected in the follow-up assessments . Both forms of CBT are successful in reducing dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions . Catastrophizing significantly predicted a less favorable outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT . Clinical implications of these results are described . Dysfunctional cognitions could be targeted more intensively in therapy and in future research on tinnitus .',\n",
       " \" Handling emergency telephone consultations ( ETCs ) is a challenging and very important task for doctors . The aims of the study were to document insecurity in medical students during ETCs and to identify the reasons for that insecurity . We hypothesised that insecurity is associated with advising more urgent action ( e.g. advice to call for an ambulance ) in ETCs . We used ETCs with simulated patients ( SPs ) , with each student randomly allocated two of four possible cases . After the training , 137 students reported on any insecurity that they had in the various ETC phases . We analysed the reasons for insecurity using descriptive statistics . The association between the students ' advice that urgent action was needed and their insecurity was analysed with Spearman rank correlation . Overall , 95 % of the students felt insecure in at least one phase of their ETC. . History taking was the phase in which students felt most insecure ( 63.1 % ) , followed by the phase of analysing the information given by the patient ( 44.9 % ) . Perceived insecurity was associated with more urgent advice in one case scenario ( abdominal pain ; correlation r = 0.46 ; p < 0.01 ) . The other two cases ( child with fever ; chest pain ) also had a positive , but not statistically significant , correlation trend ( p < 0.12 ; p < 0.08 ) . Insecurity is highly prevalent among medical students in their ETC decision-making . ETC training in medical schools , with a focus on structured history taking and formulating discriminating questions , might help decrease insecurity in ETCs . Medical education should also teach management of insecurity .\",\n",
       " ' We investigated the efficacy of intravenous ( IV ) preemptive paracetamol on postoperative total fentanyl consumption and fentanyl-related side effects in patients undergoing open nephrectomy . A total of 60 patients scheduled for elective open nephrectomy under general anesthesia were included . All patients received Patient-controlled IV analgesia with fentanyl postoperatively . Patients were randomly allocated into three equal groups : The fentanyl group received 100 mL of IV normal saline as a placebo , with the first dose ending 30 min before intubation . In paracetamol group , IV 1 g paracetamol was given to the patients 30 min after extubation with repeated doses every 6 h totally 4 times a day . In preemptive paracetamol group , patients received IV 1 g paracetamol every 6 h , with the first dose ending 30 min before intubation . Postoperative cumulative fentanyl consumption for 24 h was significantly higher in the fentanyl group ( 1009 139.361 g ) than those of paracetamol ( 752.25 112.665 g ) and preemptive paracetamol groups ( 761.10 226.625 g ) ( P = 0.001 for both ) . In early postoperative period ( 0-4 h ) ; whereas total fentanyl consumption showed no statistically significant difference among groups ( P = 0.186 ) , the nausea-vomiting scores were significantly higher in the fentanyl group compared with other groups ( P = 0.012 ) . In patients undergoing open nephrectomy , use of preemptive or postoperative paracetamol reduces fentanyl related nausea-vomiting without a decrease in total fentanyl consumption in the early postoperative period . Furthermore , use of preemptive or postoperative paracetamol reduces total fentanyl requirements in the first 24 h postoperatively providing a safe and effective postoperative analgesia .',\n",
       " ' Brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) are frequently found after carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) , but their clinical relevance remains unclear . This study sought to investigate whether periprocedural ischemic DWI lesions after CAS or carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) are associated with an increased risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events . In the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) substudy of ICSS ( International Carotid Stenting Study ) , 231 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to undergo CAS ( n = 124 ) or CEA ( n = 107 ) . MRIs were performed 1 to 7 days before and 1 to 3 days after treatment . The primary outcome event was stroke or transient ischemic attack in any territory occurring between the post-treatment MRI and the end of follow-up . Time to occurrence of the primary outcome event was compared between patients with ( DWI + ) and without ( DWI - ) new DWI lesions on the post-treatment scan in the CAS and CEA groups separately . Median time of follow-up was 4.1 years ( interquartile range : 3.0 to 5.2 ) . In the CAS group , recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred more often among DWI + patients ( 12 of 62 ) than among DWI - patients ( 6 of 62 ) , with a cumulative 5-year incidence of 22.8 % ( standard error [ SE ] : 7.1 % ) and 8.8 % ( SE : 3.8 % ) , respectively ( unadjusted hazard ratio : 2.85 ; 95 % confidence interval : 1.05 to 7.72 ; p = 0.04 ) . In DWI + and DWI - patients , 8 and 2 events , respectively , occurred within 6 months after treatment . In the CEA group , there was no difference in recurrent cerebrovascular events between DWI + and DWI - patients . Ischemic brain lesions discovered on DWI after CAS seem to be a marker of increased risk for recurrent cerebrovascular events . Patients with periprocedural DWI lesions might benefit from more aggressive and prolonged antiplatelet therapy after CAS .

We investigated the effectiveness and safety of midwives diagnosing and treating incomplete abortion with misoprostol , compared with physicians . We did a multicentre randomised controlled equivalence trial at district level at six facilities in Uganda . Eligibility criteria were women with signs of incomplete abortion . We randomly allocated women with first-trimester incomplete abortion to clinical assessment and treatment with misoprostol either by a physician or a midwife . The randomisation ( 1:1 ) was done in blocks of 12 and was stratified for study site . Primary outcome was complete abortion not needing surgical intervention within 14-28 days after initial treatment . The study was not masked . Analysis of the primary outcome was done on the per-protocol population with a generalised linear-mixed effects model . The predefined equivalence range was -4 % to 4 % . The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01844024 . From April 30 , 2013 , to July 21 , 2014 , 1108 women were assessed for eligibility . 1010 women were randomly assigned to each group ( 506 to midwife group and 504 to physician group ) . 955 women ( 472 in the midwife group and 483 in the physician group ) were included in the per-protocol analysis . 452 ( 958 % ) of women in the midwife group had complete abortion and 467 ( 967 % ) in the physician group . The model-based risk difference for midwife versus physician group was -08 % ( 95 % CI -29 to 14 ) , falling within the predefined equivalence range ( -4 % to 4 % ) . The overall proportion of women with incomplete abortion was 38 % ( 36/955 ) , similarly distributed between the two groups ( 42 % [ 20/472 ] in the midwife group , 33 % [ 16/483 ] in the physician group ) . No serious adverse events were recorded .

       " ' Much of the existing literature on physical activity ( PA ) interventions involves physically inactive individuals recruited from community settings rather than clinical practice settings . Recruitment of patients into interventions in clinical practice settings is difficult due to limited time available in the clinic , identification of appropriate personnel to efficiently conduct the process , and time-consuming methods of recruitment . The purpose of this report is to describe the approach used to identify and recruit veterans from the Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Pittsburgh Healthcare System Primary Care Clinic into a randomized controlled PA study . A sampling frame of veterans was developed using the VA electronic medical record . During regularly scheduled clinic appointments , primary care providers ( PCPs ) screened identified patients for safety to engage in moderate-intensity PA and willingness to discuss the study with research staff members . Research staff determined eligibility with a subsequent telephone screening call and scheduled a research study appointment , at which time signed informed consent and baseline measurements were obtained . Of the 3,482 veterans in the sampling frame who were scheduled for a primary care appointment during the study period , 1,990 ( 57.2 % ) were seen in the clinic and screened by the PCP ; moderate-intensity PA was deemed safe for 1,293 ( 37.1 % ) , 871 ( 25.0 % ) agreed to be contacted for further screening , 334 ( 9.6 % ) were eligible for the study , and 232 ( 6.7 % ) enrolled . Using a semiautomated screening approach that combined an electronically-derived sampling frame with paper and pencil prescreening by PCPs and research staff , VA-STRIDE was able to recruit 1 in 15 veterans in the sampling frame .

       " \" We tested the hypothesis that clevidipine , a rapidly acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , is not inferior to nitroglycerin ( NTG ) in controlling blood pressure before cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) during coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . In this double-blind study from October 4 , 2003 to April 26 , 2004 , 100 patients undergoing CABG with CPB were randomized at four centres to receive intravenous infusions of clevidipine ( 0.2-8gkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) or NTG ( 0.4 gkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) to a clinician-determined maximum dose rate ) from induction of anesthesia through 12hr postoperatively . The study drug was titrated in the pre-CPB period with the aim of maintaining mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) within 5mmHg of a clinician-predetermined target . The primary endpoint was the area under the curve ( AUC ) for the total time each patient 's MAP was outside the target range from drug initiation to the start of CPB , normalized per hour ( AUCMAP-D ) . The predefined non-inferiority criterion for the primary endpoint was a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) upper limit no greater than 1.50 for the geometric means ratio between clevidipine and NTG .

This is a blinded , randomized , controlled clinical trial to evaluate refractory cough and QOL in patients after mediastinal lymphadenectomy for lung cancer . One hundred eligible lung cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups : the fat-filling group and non-filling group . In the fat-filling group , post-lymphadenectomy residual cavities ( PLRCs ) were filled with fatty tissue autografts after lymph node dissection . In the non-filling group , the PLRCs remained unfilled . Clinical endpoints were postoperative cough score and QOL . The SFFP did not increase intraoperative bleeding , extend operation time , or hospital stay . Further , night cough was significantly improved after 4wk in the fat-filling group after the removal of a chest drainage tube . QOL issues , such as emotional condition , functional status , and additional concerns , demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the fat-filling group at postoperative 1mo compared with the non-filling ( control ) group . This study demonstrates that filling PLRCs with fatty tissue autografts is a safe and partially effective treatment for refractory cough after major pulmonary resection and mediastinal lymphadenectomy . This novel procedure significantly improved patient QOL and may prove useful as a relatively safe preventive surgical adjunct operation for refractory cough .',\n",
       " \" Modafinil has been reported to benefit a subgroup of patients suffering severe fatigue while undergoing chemotherapy . Docetaxel is associated with fatigue that may lead to premature therapy withdrawal . We investigated whether modafinil could reduce fatigue during docetaxel chemotherapy . This multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of modafinil in patients with metastatic prostate or breast cancer undergoing docetaxel chemotherapy ( every 21 days ; minimum dose 50 mg/m ( 2 ) ) . At the start of their third or subsequent chemotherapy cycle , patients with significant docetaxel-associated fatigue were randomized to receive concurrent modafinil 200 mg/day or placebo for 15 days ( `` treatment periods '' ( TP ) ) . Docetaxel was continued for up to four further cycles . Fatigue was evaluated with the fatigue component of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) . The primary endpoint was cumulative MDASI area under the curve ( AUC ) during the first 7 days of study medication during TP1 and TP2 . Evaluable data were available from 83 patients ( 65 with prostate cancer ) . There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms for the primary endpoint ( MSADI AUC3-10 35.9 vs 39.6 ; 95 % confidence interval -8.9 , 1.4 ; P = 0.15 ) . Overall toxicity was comparable between treatment groups ; however , the incidence of grade 2 nausea and vomiting was higher in the modafinil arm ( 45.4 vs 25 % ) . Assessing and managing chemotherapy-related fatigue remains a major challenge . There was a lack of difference between the two arms in the planned primary endpoint . However , there was a modest but consistent trend towards improvement of docetaxel-related fatigue in those treated with modafinil . Based on the study findings , modafinil for the treatment of fatigue associated with docetaxel chemotherapy elicits modest improvements . Larger , longer term , randomized , controlled studies are required to clarify the exact role of modafinil in the treatment of docetaxel-related fatigue .\",\n",

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability profile of low-dose TOP for relapse prevention . After detoxification , 52 patients were randomized into 2 groups as follows : 26 patients received 100 mg of TOP ( oral , twice daily ) , titrated over 2 weeks , and 26 patients received placebo ( PLA ) . Both groups underwent rehabilitation twice a week . After 6 weeks of treatment , compared with the PLA group , patients receiving TOP showed the following : ( 1 ) fewer drinking days ( P < 0.05 ) ; ( 2 ) less daily alcohol consumption ( P < 0.05 ) ; ( 3 ) more days of treatment ( P < 0.05 ) ; ( 4 ) reduced levels of craving ( Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale ) and withdrawal symptoms ( Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised ) ; and ( 5 ) improvement of anxiety , depression , and obsessive-compulsive symptom severity ( Symptom Check List 90 Revised ) . Despite the small sample size and the short follow-up period , the present PLA-controlled study demonstrated the potential usefulness of TOP , even when administered at a dosage of 100 mg/d , for the treatment of detoxified alcohol-dependent subjects , confirming results from previous studies testing higher doses of TOP .',\n",

One hundred nine patients , with inoperable abdominal or pelvic cancer , reporting visceral pain of 40-70 on a visual analogue scale and taking nonopioid analgesics were allocated randomly into two groups : either blocks were performed before Step 2 of the WHO ladder , then analgesics were managed according to the ladder ( Group I ) or analgesics were given according to the WHO ladder , and blocks were performed as the fourth step after failure of strong opioids to control pain ( Group II ) . Visual analogue scale scores , responder analysis , daily opioid consumption , related side effects , and quality of life were assessed . Responders were significantly higher in Group I ( P < 0.0001 ) , and partial responders and nonresponders significantly increased in Group II ( P < 0.0001 and 0.006 , respectively ) . Opioid consumption significantly decreased in Group I ( P < 0.0001 during first 12 months and 0.007 at the last assessment time ) , with concomitant significant reduction in related side effects . The number of patients who had a good analgesic response on tramadol significantly increased in Group I during the first five months ( P < 0.05 ) . European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 global quality-of-life subscale scores revealed significant improvement until the fifth month in Group I ( P < 0.05 ) . Sympathectomy before Step 2 on the WHO analgesic ladder seems to lead to better pain control , less opioid consumption , and better quality of life in cancer patients .',\n",
       " \" To study the effects of oromucosal detomidine gel administered sublingually to calves prior to disbudding , and to compare its efficacy with intravenously ( IV ) administered detomidine . Randomised , prospective clinical study . Twenty dairy calves aged 12.4 4.4 days ( mean SD ) , weight 50.5 9.0 kg . Detomidine at 80 g kg ( -1 ) was administered to ten calves sublingually ( GEL ) and at 30 g kg ( -1 ) to ten control calves IV ( V. jugularis ) . Meloxicam ( 0.5 mg kg ( -1 ) ) and local anaesthetic ( lidocaine 3 mg kg ( -1 ) ) were administered before heat cauterization of horn buds . Heart rate ( HR ) , body temperature and clinical sedation were monitored over 240 minutes . Blood was collected from the V. cephalica during the same period for drug concentration analysis . Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated from the plasma detomidine concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods . Statistical analyses compared routes of administration by Student 's t-test and linear mixed models as relevant . The maximum plasma detomidine concentration after GEL was 2.1 1.2 ng mL ( -1 ) ( mean SD ) and the time of maximum concentration was 66.0 36.9 minutes . The bioavailability of detomidine was approximately 34 % with GEL . Similar sedation scores were reached in both groups after administration of detomidine , but maximal sedation was reached earlier in the IV group ( 10 minutes ) than in the GEL group ( 40 minutes ) . HR was lower after IV than GEL from 5 to 10 minutes after administration . All animals were adequately sedated , and we were able to administer local anaesthetic without resistance to all of the calves before disbudding . Oromucosally administered detomidine is an effective sedative agent for calves prior to disbudding .\",\n",
       " ' Several studies have demonstrated that local ischemic preconditioning can reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac surgery patients ; however , preconditioning has not become a standard cardioprotective intervention , primarily because of the increased risk of atheroembolism during repetitive aortic cross-clamping . In the present study , we aimed to describe and validate a novel technique of preconditioning induction . Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( 12 women and 78 men ; mean age , 5611years ) were randomized into 3 groups : ( 1 ) Controls ( n = 30 ) , ( 2 ) Perfusion ( n = 30 ) , and ( 3 ) Preconditioning ( n = 30 ) . All patients were operated under cardiopulmonary bypass using normothermic blood cardioplegia . Preconditioning was induced by subjecting the hemodynamically unloaded heart to 2cycles of 3min of ischemia and 3min of reperfusion with normokalemic blood prior to cardioplegia . In the Perfusion group , the heart perfusion remained unaffected for 12min . Troponin I ( TnI ) levels were analyzed before surgery , and 12 , 24 , 48h , and 7days after surgery . The secondary endpoints included the cardiac index , plasma natriuretic peptide level , and postoperative use of inotropes . Preconditioning resulted in a significant reduction in the TnI level on the 7th postoperative day only ( 0.100.05 and 0.330.88 ng/ml in Preconditioning and Perfusion groups , respectively , P < 0.05 ) . In addition , cardiac index was significantly higher in the Preconditioning group than in the Control and Perfusion groups just after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass . The number of patients requiring inotropic support with2 agents after surgery was significantly lower in the Preconditioning and Perfusion group than in the Control group ( P < 0.05 ) . No complications of the procedure were recorded in the Preconditioning group . The preconditioning procedure described can be performed safely in cardiac surgery patients . The application of this technique of preconditioning was associated with certain benefits , including improved left ventricular function after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and a reduced need for inotropic support . However , the infarct-limiting effect of preconditioning in the early postoperative period was not evident . The procedure does not involve repetitive aortic cross-clamping , thus avoiding possible embolic complications .',\n",
       " ' Minimal-change nephrotic syndrome ( MCNS ) is a common cause of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) with frequent relapse . Although steroids and calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ) are the cornerstone treatments , the use of rituximab ( RTX ) , a monoclonal antibody targeting B cells , is an efficient and safe alternative in childhood . Because data from adults remain sparse , we conducted a large retrospective and multicentric study that included 41 adults with MCNS and receiving RTX . Complete ( NS remission and withdrawal of all immunosuppressants ) and partial ( NS remission and withdrawal of at least one immunosuppressants ) clinical responses were obtained for 25 and 7 patients , respectively ( overall response 78 % ) , including 3 patients that only received RTX and had a complete clinical response . After a follow-up time of 39 months ( 6-71 ) , relapses occurred in 18 responder patients [ 56 % , median time 18 months ( 3-36 ) ] . Seventeen of these received a second course of RTX and then had a complete ( n = 13 ) or partial ( n = 4 ) clinical response . From multivariate analysis , on-going mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) therapy at the time of RTX was the only predictive factor for RTX failure [ HR = 0.07 95 % CI ( 0.01-0 .04 ) , P = 0.003 ] . Interestingly , nine patients were still in remission at 14 months ( 3-36 ) after B-cell recovery . No significant early or late adverse event occurred after RTX therapy . RTX is safe and effective in adult patients with MCNS and could be an alternative to steroids or CNIs in patients with a long history of relapsing MCNS .',\n",
       " ' Extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) of blood during cardiopulmonary surgery has been shown to stimulate various proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines and chemokines . The biochemical oxidation/reduction pathways of - lipoic acid suggest that it may have antioxidant properties . In this study we aimed to evaluate only patients with coronary heart disease and those planned for coronary artery bypass graft operation . Blood samples were obtained from the patients before the operation ( P1 ) and one ( P2 ) , four ( P3 ) , 24 ( P4 ) and 48 hours ( P5 ) after administration of - lipoic acid ( LA ) . The patients were divided into two groups , control and LA treatment group . Levels of interleukin - 6 ( IL-6 ) and -8 ( IL-8 ) , complement 3 ( C3 ) and 4 ( C4 ) , anti-streptolysin ( ASO ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and haptoglobin were assessed in the blood samples . Cytokine IL-6 and IL-8 levels were significantly higher after surgery . Compared with the control groups , LA significantly decreased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in a time-dependent manner . CRP levels did not show significant variation in the first three time periods . CRP levels were higher after surgery , especially in the later periods . These results demonstrate that CRP formation depends on cytokine release . C3 and C4 levels were significantly higher after surgery than in the pre-operative period . LA treatment decreased C3 and C4 levels . Therefore , LA administration may be useful for the treatment of diseases and processes where excessive cytokine release could cause oxidative damage . Our findings suggest a possible benefit of using LA during cardiac surgery to reduce cytokine levels .',\n",
       " ' To study the intraocular distribution and safety of polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles loaded with carboplatin after posterior subtenon injection in humans . Prospective , interventional , comparative case series . Six patients ( mean age : 26.83 7.5 years ) , scheduled to undergo planned uniocular enucleation in aninstitutional setting , were randomly divided into 3 groups . Each group received a 10mg/mL posterior subtenon injection of nanoparticle carboplatin in the eye to be enucleated . Two eyes were enucleated 6 , 24 and 72 hours post injection . Intravenous blood was collected during enucleation . The concentration of carboplatin reaching various intraocular tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy . The drug toxicity in the ocular tissues was assessed by histopathology and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy . The highest level of carboplatin was detected in retinas ( 8.33 1.69 mg/g ) , up to 24 hours post treatment . The intravitreal concentration continued to increase gradually until 72 hours ( 3.46 0.26 mg/g ) . The choroids and lenses showed very low levels of carboplatin after 6 hours , with negligible amounts at 72 hours . No signs of tissue damage were observed on histopathology or electron microscopy . Intravenous concentration of carboplatin was undetectable in all patients . Results may indicate an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of nanoparticle carboplatin , with a sustained-release behavior but without any associated short-term ocular or systemic side effects in humans . The very high concentrations achieved in vitreous and retina after a single posterior subtenon injection may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeds . However , further studies are needed to assess long-term toxicity andclinical efficacy .',\n",

Serial wide-field fluorescein angiography was performed on 12 preproliferative central retinal vein occlusion eyes in the 3-year Rubeosis Anti-VEGF ( RAVE ) trial using the Staurenghi lens ( Ocular Staurenghi 230SLO Retina Lens ) with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( Heidelberg HRA Spectralis ) . `` Disk area '' was defined anatomically for each eye . Mean total field of gradable retina was 290 disk areas ( range , 178-452 ) . All eyes demonstrated extensive areas of retinal nonperfusion ; at baseline , mean area of retinal perfusion was 106 disk areas ( range , 37-129 ) , correlating with a mean of 46.5 % perfused retinal area ( range , 19.1-56 .4 % ) . The area of retinal nonperfusion increased in all eyes with a mean loss of approximately 8.1 % of perfused retinal area per year ( range , 4.3-12 .4 % ) , which corresponded to a mean 15-disk areas ( range , 12-35 ) of retina evolving from perfused to nonperfused annually . The extent of baseline and final nonperfusion was not significantly different between eyes that developed neovascularization and eyes that did not . In this population of severe central retinal vein occlusion eyes , profound retinal nonperfusion was observed with wide-field fluorescein angiography at baseline and the extent of nonperfusion progressed while undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy .\",\n",

The postimplantation syndrome after EVAR may delay recovery due to the release of proinflammatory mediators . Glucocorticoids may reduce postoperative inflammatory responses and enhance recovery , but with limited information on EVAR . A single-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of 153 patients undergoing elective EVAR between November 2009 and January 2013 . Patients received 30 mg/kg of methylprednisolone ( MP ) ( n = 77 ) or placebo ( n = 76 ) preoperatively . Primary outcome was a modified version of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome . Secondary outcome measures were the effect on inflammatory biomarkers , morbidity , and time to meet discharge criteria . Of 153 randomized patients , 150 ( 98 % ) were evaluated for the primary outcome . MP reduced systemic inflammatory response syndrome from 92 % to 27 % ( P < 0.0001 ) ( number needed to treat = 1.5 ) , maximal plasma interleukin 6 from 186 pg/mL [ interquartile range ( IQR ) = 113-261 pg/mL ] to 20 pg/mL ( IQR = 11-28 pg/mL ) ( P < 0.001 ) and fulfillment of discharge criteria was shorter [ 2 days ( IQR = 2-4 days ) vs 3 days ( IQR = 3-4 days ) ] ( P < 0.001 ) . C-reactive protein , temperature , interleukin 8 , and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor were also reduced ( P < 0.001 ) by MP .

Prospective split-mouth study , 0.022-inch SmartClip self-ligating brackets assigned randomly to the left or right dentition , conventional 0.018-inch brackets on the other side . 52 dental landmarks , digitized on plaster casts , represented dental arches at baseline ( t0 ) , 6 months and 9 months ( t1 , t2 ) . During t0-t1 , we used 0.016 and 0.014 x 0.025 inch superelastic wires , during t1-t2 connected reverse-curve hemiarch wires : 0.017 x 0.025 inch - titanium on the ligature-less side , and 0.016 x 0.022 inch Elgiloy multiloop wires on conventional brackets . Morphometric analyses were used to assess differences in dental arch shapes . Neither initial alignment nor the reverse-curve phase showed statistically significant differences between ligature-less and conventional brackets in moving teeth . Morphometric shape analyses corroborated current evidence that self-ligating brackets were no more effective than conventional brackets with steel ligatures after 6-month initial alignment .

A prospective , longitudinal , randomized , controlled trial . Oncology clinics , breast cancer support groups , and communities in Colorado . 56 middle-aged BCSs with chronic insomnia . Women were randomly assigned to CBTI or behavioral placebo treatment ( BPT ) and completed measures of sleep , QOL , functioning , fatigue , and mood at baseline , postintervention , and at three - and six-month follow-ups . Sleep outcomes ( e.g. , sleep efficiency , sleep latency , total sleep time , wake after sleep onset , number of nightly awakenings ) ; secondary variables included sleep medication use , insomnia severity , QOL , physical function , cognitive function , fatigue , depression , anxiety , and sleep attitudes or knowledge . Sleep efficiency and latency improved more in the CBTI group than the BPT group ; this difference was maintained during follow-up . Women in the CBTI group had less subjective insomnia , greater improvements in physical and cognitive functioning , positive sleep attitudes , and increased sleep hygiene knowledge . No group differences in improvement were noted relative to QOL , fatigue , or mood . Nurse-delivered CBTI appears to be beneficial for BCSs ' sleep latency/efficiency , insomnia severity , functioning , sleep knowledge , and attitudes more than active placebo , with sustained benefit over time .

Solar lentigines , especially those which are light in color , show somewhat limited response to pigment lasers and intense pulsed light sources . We sought to compare the early effects as well as side effects of Q-switched Nd : YAG and Er : YAG micropeel in treating light solar lentigines in Asians . This was a split-face , evaluator-blind , randomized controlled study . A single session of treatment was performed on Asian patients with light facial lentigines . Q-switched Nd : YAG laser was allocated to one half of the face , and Er : YAG micropeel to the other half . The response to therapy was evaluated by two independent dermatologists with standardized photographs taken 2 weeks and 1 month after the laser treatment . Patients ' satisfaction and preference in treatment were also assessed . Fifteen patients completed the study and were analyzed . A reduction in pigment was observed with both lasers during the study period . The degree of pigment reduction in the Q-switched Nd : YAG treated side of the face was significantly higher than that of the Er : YAG micropeel treated side at 2-week follow-up ( p < 0.001 ) . The degree of pigment reduction between the Q-switched Nd : YAG-treated side and the Er : YAG micropeel-treated side was similar at 1-month follow-up ( p = 0.110 ) . While there is no perfect therapy for light solar lentigines , a single session of Q-switched Nd : YAG laser and Er : YAG micropeel was shown to reduce pigmentation . The immediate effects ( 2-week follow-up ) were better with the Q-switched Nd : YAG laser but there was no great difference between the two laser types at 1-month follow-up due to the greater degree of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation following Q-switched Nd : YAG .

       " ' Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the - subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor with demonstrated benefits in the treatment of multiple sclerosis . The present work aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of daclizumab high-yield process ( HYP ) in healthy volunteers . Three double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , phaseI studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics of daclizumab HYP in healthy volunteers following single subcutaneous administration ( 50 , 150 , or 300mg ) , multiple subcutaneous administrations ( 100 or 200mg biweekly with a 200mg loading dose ) , or single intravenous administration ( 200 or 400mg ) . Measurable serum concentrations ( n = 925 ) from 70 subjects treated with daclizumab HYP in the three studies were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling . A two-compartment model with a first-order absorption and elimination adequately described daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetics . Daclizumab HYP clearance , inter-compartmental clearance , and central and peripheral volumes of distribution were 10mL/h , 44mL/h , 3.89 L , and 2.52 L , respectively , scaled by [ bodyweight ( kg ) / 70 ] with 0.54 and 0.64 exponents for clearance and volume parameters , respectively . Lag-time , mean absorption time , and absolute bioavailability ( 100-300mg ) for subcutaneous administration were 2h , 4.6 days , and 84 % , respectively . Bodyweight explained only ~ 20 % of daclizumab HYP pharmacokinetic variability . With this limited dataset , sex , age , race , or presence of antibodies did not correlate with daclizumab HYP clearance . The estimated effective half-life was 21-25days . The developed model was robust in bootstrap evaluation and predicted the data adequately in stochastic simulations . Daclizumab HYP is characterized by slow clearance , linear pharmacokinetics ( at doses100mg ) , high subcutaneous bioavailability , and a half-life suitable for monthly administration .',\n",
       " ' The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends targeting a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg during initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock .

A comparative study design was adopted . A sample of 39 healthy people was randomly divided into three groups . Subjects in all groups used an earphone that had been correctly placed in the right ear only : Group 1 : listened to heavy metal music through the earphone ( 13 participants ) ; Group 2 : listened to classical music through the earphone ( 13 participants ) ; Group 3 : no music or sound was transmitted through the earphone ( 13 participants ) . Average differences ( CI 95 % ) and Pearson correlations for the temperature measured in the right ear , which was exposed to the different independent variables , and the left ear which was not exposed , were calculated at different times : ( 1 ) after 10 minutes compared to the baseline measurement ; ( 2 ) after 30 minutes compared to the 10 minutes measurement ; and ( 3 ) after 30 minutes compared to the baseline measurement . The inter-ear temperature correlation at the baseline was Pearson r .801 ( p = .01 ) . There was a significant decrease in the correlations between right and left ear temperatures in Group 1 and in Group 3 which was demonstrated after 10 minutes of earphone use , and reached critical values after 30 minutes of use in all groups . The average warmth in the right ear , as perceived by participants after 20 minutes , was reported .

Intention-to-treat analysis ( n = 162 ) using last measured weights showed that mean change in BMI by 1 year post surgery was -16.49 . There was no significant difference between the two groups ( control group = -16.37 , 95 % CI = 15.15-17 .57 ; intervention = -16.6 , 95 % CI = 15.42-17 .81 ; p ( 2 ) = 0.001 ) . Similarly , explanatory analysis ( n = 145 ) showed a mean change in BMI of -17.17 . The difference between the two groups was not significant ( control group = -16.9 , 95 % CI = 15.78-18 .18 ; intervention = -17.35 , 95 % CI = 18.5-16 .16 ; p ( 2 ) = 0.001 ) . Psychological support pre and post bariatric surgery had no impact on weight loss as measured by BMI and change in BMI by 1 year . It is argued that psychological support should be targeted to patients who start to demonstrate weight regain at a later stage . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01264120 .\",\n",
       " ' The Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent is a newly developed third-generation drug-eluting stent , featuring a unique dual-polymer mix . An active bioabsorbable polymer delivers the anti-proliferative drug , sirolimus , via controlled release , while a passive biocompatible polymeric coating shields the metallic strut from surrounding tissue , preventing interaction . To date , the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent has excelled in terms of late lumen loss at 9 months in a first-in-man single-arm trial . However , the efficacy and safety data for Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stents in a broader population of all-comers are limited . The present study offers an angiographic and clinical comparison of the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent and the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease . The ORIENT trial is a multicenter , randomized , open-label , parallel-arm study designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent relative to the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent . A total of 375 patients with a spectrum of coronary artery disease will undergo prospective , random assignment to a Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent or Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent ( 2:1 ratio ) , for a primary endpoint of in-stent late lumen loss at 9 months by quantitative coronary angiography . Secondary 12-month clinical endpoints are death , target lesion revascularization , target vessel revascularization , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis and target lesion failure ( a composite of cardiac death , target lesion revascularization and target vessel-related myocardial infarction ) . The ORIENT trial is the first study to date comparing the Orsiro Hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent with the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent for efficacy and safety in a population of all-comers with coronary artery disease .

       " ' Patients receiving oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) who undergo drug-eluting stent ( DES ) implantation require additional dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel . Such triple therapy confers an elevated bleeding risk , and its optimal duration is not known . The goal of this study was to evaluate whether shortening the duration of clopidogrel therapy from 6 months to 6 weeks after DES implantation was associated with a superior net clinical outcome in patients receiving concomitant aspirin and OAC . In this randomized , open-label trial , we enrolled patients receiving OAC who underwent DES implantation at 3 European centers between September 2008 and December 2013 . A total of 614 patients receiving concomitant aspirin and OAC were randomized to either 6-week clopidogrel therapy ( n = 307 ) or 6-month clopidogrel therapy ( n = 307 ) . The primary endpoint was a composite of death , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , definite stent thrombosis , stroke , or Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) major bleeding at 9 months . The primary endpoint occurred in 30 patients ( 9.8 % ) in the 6-week group compared with 27 patients ( 8.8 % ) in the 6-month group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 1.14 ; 95 % CI : 0.68 to 1.91 ; p = 0.63 ) . There were no significant differences for the secondary combined ischemic endpoint of cardiac death , MI , definite stent thrombosis , and ischemic stroke ( 12 [ 4.0 % ] vs. 13 [ 4.3 % ] ; HR : 0.93 ; 95 % CI : 0.43 to 2.05 ; p = 0.87 ) or the secondary bleeding endpoint of TIMI major bleeding ( 16 [ 5.3 % ] vs. 12 [ 4.0 % ] ; HR : 1.35 ; 95 % CI : 0.64 to 2.84 ; p = 0.44 ) . Six weeks of triple therapy was not superior to 6 months with respect to net clinical outcomes . These results suggest that physicians should weigh the trade-off between ischemic and bleeding risk when choosing the shorter or longer duration of triple therapy .

       " ' The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial previously showed that intensive glucose lowering , as compared with standard therapy , did not significantly reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events among 1791 military veterans ( median follow-up , 5.6 years ) . We report the extended follow-up of the study participants . After the conclusion of the clinical trial , we followed participants , using central databases to identify procedures , hospitalizations , and deaths ( complete cohort , with follow-up data for 92.4 % of participants ) . Most participants agreed to additional data collection by means of annual surveys and periodic chart reviews ( survey cohort , with 77.7 % follow-up ) . The primary outcome was the time to the first major cardiovascular event ( heart attack , stroke , new or worsening congestive heart failure , amputation for ischemic gangrene , or cardiovascular-related death ) . Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality . The difference in glycated hemoglobin levels between the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group averaged 1.5 percentage points during the trial ( median level , 6.9 % vs. 8.4 % ) and declined to 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points by 3 years after the trial ended . Over a median follow-up of 9.8 years , the intensive-therapy group had a significantly lower risk of the primary outcome than did the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 0.83 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.70 to 0.99 ; P = 0.04 ) , with an absolute reduction in risk of 8.6 major cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years , but did not have reduced cardiovascular mortality ( hazard ratio , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.64 to 1.20 ; P = 0.42 ) .

       " ' To determine inter - and intra-tester reliability of strength measurements during maximal electrically induced contractions ( MEIC ) using a hand-held dynamometer ( HHD ) . Thirty-seven healthy young female adults , mean age ( SD ) 23.4 ( 2.4 ) years , were tested by two examiners during two sessions , with order of examiners randomized . Biphasic pulses ( phase duration -- 300s ; pulse frequency -- 75Hz ) were employed in order to induce contractions of the quadriceps femoris muscle at a maximally tolerated current level . Strength of maximal voluntary isometric contractions ( MVIC ) and of MEIC was recorded with a HHD utilizing a stabilization belt . Good to excellent inter - and intra-tester reliability were determined with intra-class correlation coefficients ranging between 0.8 and 0.9 , and no bias in the Bland-Altman plots . The 95 % repeatability ranged between 8.7 and 13.0 kg for the MVIC and MEIC , and between 20.7 and 25.6 % for the % MVIC . Our results confirm previous findings indicating good to excellent reliability of quadriceps femoris muscle MVIC assessment with a HHD . However , a high 95 % repeatability range indicates the HHD is not sufficiently reliable as an indicator of the force level attained during electrically induced contractions . Other methods need to be investigated to assist in determining whether MEIC have reached therapeutic levels .',\n",
       " ' To compare the effects of a 3-week supplementation between two different mixtures of antioxidants and placebo on aerobic exercise performance in acute normobaric hypoxia . Seventeen subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive a broad-based antioxidants supplement containing beta-carotene , ascorbic acid , d-alpha-tocopherol-succinate , N-acetylcysteine , riboflavin , zinc , and selenium ( antioxidant capsule group [ AO group ] ) , or a combination of alpha-ketoglutaric acid ( - KG ) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural ( 5-HMF ; CYL concentrate supplementation group [ CS group ] ) , or placebo ( PL group ) . Before and after supplementation , subjects performed two incremental cycle-exercise tests until exhaustion . The first test was conducted under normoxic conditions ( LA , FiO2 of 20.9 % , ~ 547 m ) and the second after the 3-week supplementation period under normobaric hypoxic conditions ( AHA , FiO2 of 12.9 % , ~ 4300m ) . In CS peak cycling performance ( peak power ) declined from LA to AHA 7.3 % ( 90 % CI : 2.2-12 .4 ) less compared with PL ( p = .04 ) and 6.7 % ( 90 % CI : 3.2-10 .2 ) less compared with AO ( p = .03 ) . Better maintenance of aerobic exercise capacity in CS was associated with an attenuated reduction in maximal heart rate in hypoxia . Aerobic exercise performance was less impaired in acute normobaric hypoxia after 3 weeks with supplementation of - KG and 5-HMF compared with a broad-based antioxidants supplement or PL .',\n",

We report efficacy and safety data up to week 96 of the study . The RAPID-axSpA trial is double-blind and placebo-controlled to week 24 , dose-blind to week 48 , and open-label to week 204 . Outcome variables included Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for 20 % and 40 % improvement in disease activity ( ASAS20/40 ) , ASAS partial remission responses ( analyzed by nonresponder imputation ) , AS Disease Activity Score ( ASDAS ) , ASDAS inactive disease , ASDAS major improvement , Bath AS Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) , Bath AS Functional Index ( BASFI ) , and Bath AS Metrology Index ( BASMI ) linear score ( analyzed by the last observation carried forward method ) . Safety data were collected for patients treated with 1 dose of CZP . Of the 325 patients who were randomized , 218 received CZP from week 0 . Of these , 93 % completed week 24 , 88 % completed week 48 , and 80 % completed week 96 . Improvements in ASAS responses were maintained to week 96 ( for ASAS20 , 67.4 % , 72.0 % , and 62.8 % at weeks 24 , 48 , and 96 , respectively ) , as well as improvements in ASDAS , BASDAI ( mean score 3.3 , 3.1 , and 3.0 at weeks 24 , 48 , and 96 , respectively ) , BASFI , and BASMI linear score . Comparable improvements were observed with both dosing regimens ( 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks ) and in patients with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA . In the safety set , adverse events occurred in 279 patients ( 88.6 % ) and serious adverse events in 41 ( 13.0 % ) . No deaths or malignancies were reported . Clinical improvements to week 24 in both CZP dosing regimens were sustained to week 96 . Similar sustained improvements were observed in AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations .

       " ' Transradial access ( TRA ) has been associated with reduced access site-related bleeding complications and mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . It is unclear , however , whether these observed benefits are influenced by baseline bleeding risk . This study investigated the relationship between baseline bleeding risk , TRA utilization , and procedure-related outcomes in patients undergoing PCI enrolled in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database . Baseline bleeding risk was calculated by using modified Mehran bleeding risk scores in 348,689 PCI procedures performed between 2006 and 2011 . Four categories for bleeding risk were defined for the modified Mehran risk score ( MMRS ) : low ( < 10 ) , moderate ( 10 to 14 ) , high ( 15 to 19 ) , and very high ( 20 ) . The impact of baseline bleeding risk on 30-day mortality and its relationship with access site were studied . TRA was independently associated with a 35 % reduction in 30-day mortality risk ( odds ratio [ OR ] : 0.65 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.59 to 0.72 ] ; p < 0.0001 ) , with the magnitude of mortality reduction related to baseline bleeding risk ( MMRS < 10 , OR : 0.73 [ 95 % CI : 0.62 to 0.86 ] ; MMRS 20 , OR : 0.53 [ 95 % CI : 0.47 to 0.61 ] ) . In patients with an MMRS < 10 , TRA was used in 71,771 ( 43.2 % ) of 166,083 PCI procedures ; TRA was used in 8,655 ( 40.1 % ) of 21,559 PCI procedures in patients with an MMRS 20 , illustrating that TRA was used less in those at highest risk from bleeding complications ( p < 0.0001 ) . TRA was independently associated with reduced 30-day mortality , and the magnitude of this effect was related to baseline bleeding risk ; those at highest risk of bleeding complications gained the greatest benefit from adoption of TRA during PCI .',\n",

We aimed to determine whether serum procalcitonin ( PCT ) levels can effectively and safely reduce antibiotic exposure in patients experiencing exacerbations of asthma . In this randomized controlled trial , a total of 216 patients requiring hospitalization for severe acute exacerbations of asthma were screened for eligibility to participate and 169 completed the 12-month follow-up visit . Patients were randomized to either PCT-guided ( PCT group ) or standard ( control group ) antimicrobial therapy . In the control group , patients received antibiotics according to the attending physician 's discretion ; in the PCT group , patients received antibiotics according to an algorithm based on serum PCT levels . The primary end point was antibiotic exposure ; secondary end points were clinical recovery , length of hospital stay , clinical and laboratory parameters , spirometry , number of asthma exacerbations , emergency room visits , hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma . PCT guidance reduced antibiotic prescription ( 48.9 % versus 87.8 % , respectively ; P < 0.001 ) and antibiotic exposure ( relative risk , 0.56 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.44 to 0.70 ; P < 0.001 ) compared to standard therapy . There were no significant differences in clinical recovery , length of hospital stay or clinical , laboratory and spirometry outcomes in both groups . Number of asthma exacerbations , emergency room visits , hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma were similar during the 12-month follow-up period .

       " ' Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) bronchiolitis in infancy is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma . Because azithromycin attenuated neutrophilic airway inflammation in a murine viral bronchiolitis model , demonstration of similar effects in human subjects might provide a strategy for the prevention of postbronchiolitis recurrent wheezing . We sought to investigate whether azithromycin treatment during RSV bronchiolitis reduces serum and nasal lavage IL-8 levels and the occurrence of postbronchiolitis recurrent wheezing . We performed a randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial in 40 otherwise healthy infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis who were treated with azithromycin or placebo for 14 days . IL-8 levels were measured in nasal lavage fluid and serum on randomization , day 8 , and day 15 ( nasal lavage only ) . The occurrence of wheezing episodes was assessed monthly over the ensuing 50 weeks . Compared with placebo , azithromycin treatment did not reduce serum IL-8 levels at day 8 ( P = .6 ) but resulted in a greater decrease in nasal lavage fluid IL-8 levels by day 15 ( P = .03 ) . Twenty-two percent of azithromycin-treated participants experienced at least 3 wheezing episodes compared with 50 % of participants in the placebo group ( P = .07 ) . Azithromycin treatment resulted in prolonged time to the third wheezing episode ( P = .048 ) and in fewer days with respiratory symptoms over the subsequent year in comparison with placebo ( 36.7 vs 70.1 days , P = .01 ) . In this proof-of-concept study azithromycin treatment during RSV bronchiolitis reduced upper airway IL-8 levels , prolonged the time to the third wheezing episode , and reduced overall respiratory morbidity over the subsequent year .',\n",

       " \" Considering the increasing incidence of chronic kidney disease and the increased use of peritoneal dialysis , we wanted to assess whether the multidisciplinary management of patients in peritoneal dialysis might produce improvement in the quality of patients ' lives when compared to management by a routine team of operators . Our study observed 40 patients on peritoneal dialysis in our Department between 2010 and 2012 . They were randomly assigned to either group A , the routine team which consisted of a nephrologist and a nurse , or group B , a multidisciplinary team comprising several medical specialists , a nurse , a psychologist and a social worker . Two tests , KDQOL-SF and MMPI-2 , were administered to both groups . In group B , the number of days of hospitalization and day hospital were more than 88 % lower when compared to group A. The multidisciplinary team achieved better results with the KDQOL-SF test with regards to both emotional and objective dimensions . The Pearson coefficient between the results of the two questionnaires shows how multidisciplinary management can positively influence the perceived well-being of the patient and his or her adherence to treatment . In a multidisciplinary team , each operator , in addition to his or her specific role , also contributes to the achievement of the overall objective , namely of ensuring an optimal quality of life to the patient on peritoneal dialysis thereby allowing these patients to continue their professional and social lives .\",\n",
       " ' Changes in pulmonary dynamics following laparotomy are well documented . Deep breathing exercises , with or without incentive spirometry , may help counteract postoperative decreased vital capacity ; however , the evidence for the role of incentive spirometry in the prevention of postoperative atelectasis is inconclusive . Furthermore , data are scarce regarding the prevention of postoperative atelectasis in sub-Saharan Africa . To determine the effect of the use of incentive spirometry on pulmonary function following exploratory laparotomy as measured by forced vital capacity ( FVC ) . This was a single-center , randomized clinical trial performed at Kamuzu Central Hospital , Lilongwe , Malawi . Study participants were adult patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy and were randomized into the intervention or control groups ( standard of care ) from February 1 to November 30 , 2013 . All patients received routine postoperative care , including instructions for deep breathing and early ambulation . We used bivariate analysis to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups . Adult patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy participated in postoperative deep breathing exercises . Patients in the intervention group received incentive spirometers . We assessed pulmonary function using a peak flow meter to measure FVC in both groups of patients . Secondary outcomes , such as hospital length of stay and mortality , were obtained from the medical records . A total of 150 patients were randomized ( 75 in each arm ) . The median age in the intervention and control groups was 35 years ( interquartile range , 28-53 years ) and 33 years ( interquartile range , 23-46 years ) , respectively . Men predominated in both groups , and most patients underwent emergency procedures ( 78.7 % in the intervention group and 84.0 % in the control group ) . Mean initial FVC did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups ( 0.92 and 0.90 L , respectively ; P = .82 [ 95 % CI , 0.52-2 .29 ] ) . Although patients in the intervention group tended to have higher final FVC measurements , the change between the first and last measured FVC was not statistically significant ( 0.29 and 0.25 L , respectively ; P = .68 [ 95 % CI , 0.65-1 .95 ] ) . Likewise , hospital length of stay did not differ significantly between groups .

The key secondary measure was the change in task response latency . No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in the primary or key secondary outcomes . Armodafinil was generally well tolerated . The most common adverse events ( occurring in more than one patient [ 5 % ] ) were headache ( 19 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 14 % ) , and diarrhea ( 10 % ) . Armodafinil did not improve fMRI-measured functional brain activation in CPAP-treated patients with OSA and excessive sleepiness .

       " \" Antisocial behaviour and adult criminality often have their origins in childhood and are best addressed early in the child 's life using evidence-based treatments such as the ` Incredible Years Parent Programme ' . However , families with additional risk factors who are at highest risk for poor outcomes do not always make sufficient change while attending such programmes . Additional support to address barriers and improve implementation of positive parenting strategies while these families attend the Incredible Years Programme may improve overall outcomes.The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of adding a structured home visiting intervention ( Home Parent Support ) to improve outcomes in families most at risk of poor treatment response from the Incredible Years intervention . This study will inform the design of a larger prospective randomised controlled trial . A pilot single-blind , parallel , superiority , randomised controlled trial . Randomisation will be undertaken using a computer-generated sequence in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatments arranged in permuted blocks with stratification by age , sex , and ethnicity . One hundred and twenty six participants enrolled in the Incredible Years Parent Programme who meet the high-risk criteria will be randomly allocated to receive either Incredible Years Parent Programme and Home Parent Support , or the Incredible Years Parent Programme alone . The Home Parent Support is a 10-session structured home visiting intervention provided by a trained therapist , alongside the usual Incredible Years Parent Programme , to enhance the adoption of key parenting skills . The primary outcome is the change in child behaviour from baseline to post-intervention in parent reported Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory Problem Scale . This is the first formal evaluation of adding Home Parent Support alongside Incredible Years Parent Programme for families with risk factors who typically have poorer treatment outcomes . We anticipate that the intervention will help vulnerable families stay engaged , strengthen the adoption of effective parenting strategies , and improve outcomes for both the children and families .

       " \" Childhood obesity is a growing concern in Sweden . Children with overweight and obesity run a high risk of becoming obese as adults , and are likely to develop comorbidities . Despite the immense demand , there is still a lack of evidence-based comprehensive prevention programmes targeting pre-school children and their families in primary health care settings . The aims are to describe the design and methodology of the PRIMROSE cluster-randomised controlled trial , assess the relative validity of a food frequency questionnaire , and describe the baseline characteristics of the eligible young children and their mothers . The PRIMROSE trial targets first-time parents and their children at Swedish child health centres ( CHC ) in eight counties in Sweden . Randomisation is conducted at the CHC unit level . CHC nurses employed at the participating CHC received training in carrying out the intervention alongside their provision of regular services . The intervention programme , starting when the child is 8-9months of age and ending at age 4 , is based on social cognitive theory and employs motivational interviewing . Primary outcomes are children 's body mass index and waist circumference at fouryears . Secondary outcomes are children 's and mothers ' eating habits ( assessed by a food frequency questionnaire ) , and children 's and mothers ' physical activity ( measured by accelerometer and a validated questionnaire ) , and mothers ' body mass index and waist circumference . The on-going population-based PRIMROSE trial , which targets childhood obesity , is embedded in the regular national ( routine ) preventive child health services that are available free-of-charge to all young families in Sweden . Of the participants ( n = 1369 ) , 489 intervention and 550 control mothers ( 75.9 % ) responded to the validated physical activity and food frequency questionnaire at baseline ( i.e. , before the first intervention session , or , for children in the control group , before they reached 10months of age ) . The food frequency questionnaire showed acceptable relative validity when compared with an 8-day food diary . We are not aware of any previous RCT , concerned with the primary prevention of childhood obesity through sessions at CHC that addresses healthy eating habits and physical activity in the context of a routine child health services programme .

       " ' To investigate the effects of lutein supplementation on plasma lutein concentrations and the macular pigment optical density ( MPOD ) in central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) . In this double-masked placebo-controlled study , 20 patients received lutein 20 mg/d and 19 received placebo . The plasma lutein concentration and MPOD using autofluorescence spectrometry ( density unit , DU ) were measured at baseline and 1 and 4 months . The mean plasma lutein concentrations and MPOD values in the lutein and control groups , respectively , were 91.5 and 78.2 ng/mL and 0.444 and 0.437 DU at baseline ; 204.9 and 79.3 ng/mL and 0.460 and 0.442 DU at 1 month ; and 228.0 and 78.4 ng/mL and 0.441 and 0.421 DU at 4 months . The plasma concentration in the lutein group was significantly higher than in controls at 1 and 4 months ( P < 0.0001 for both comparisons ) ; however , the MPOD values did not differ significantly between groups at 1 ( P = 0.479 ) or 4 months ( P = 0.883 ) . In patients with a plasma lutein concentration below the mean level in 20 age-matched healthy subjects ( mean 105.3 ng/mL ; n = 13 in lutein group , n = 15 in control group ) , the control MPOD values significantly ( P = 0.0430 ) decreased at 4 months ( mean baseline , 0.437 DU ; 4 months , 0.404 DU ) .

The MPOD did not increase in patients with CSC with short-term lutein supplementation ; however , among patients with low plasma lutein , supplemental lutein prevented a decline in MPOD that was observed in control subjects ( www.umin.ac.jp/ctr number , UMIN000005849 ) .',\n",
       " ' Fluid therapy is widely used in critically ill patients to restore effective intravascular volume and improve organ perfusion . Recent studies have questioned the administration of colloid-based solutions , especially if containing hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) , in different ICU populations ; however , there is still uncertainty on the use of colloids as initial fluid therapy for early resuscitation . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different resuscitation fluid strategies on the mortality of patients with shock . In a multicentric ( 57 ICUs ) , controlled , open-label trial ( from February 2003 to August 2012 ) , the authors randomized patients with signs of acute hypovolemia , defined by the combination of hypotension , evidence of low filling pressures or cardiac index and at least two signs of tissue hypoperfusion ( such as altered consciousness , mottled skin , oliguria , lactate levels > 2 mmol/L ) , to received either a colloid - or crystalloid-based therapy . Both cohorts received maintenance fluids consisting in isotonic crystalloids and albumin in case of severe hypoalbuminemia ( < 2 g/dL ) . Exclusion criteria included previous fluid therapy , pregnancy , brain death , extended burns , chronic hemodialysis or liver disease , known coagulopathy , acute anaphylaxis , dehydration and hypotension due to sedative drugs . Among the 6498 eligible patients , 2857 were eventually randomized in one of the two groups . The 28-day mortality was 25.4 % in the colloid and 27.0 % in the crystalloid group ( P = 0.26 ) . In the sub-group analysis , similar mortality rates were reported for shock due to hypovolemia , sepsis or trauma . Also , the use of continuous renal replacement therapy was similar between groups ( 11.0 % vs. 12.5 % , P = 0.19 ) . There were more days alive without mechanical ventilation or vasopressors during the first 7 and 28 days and a lower 90-day mortality in the colloid group . These data suggest that mortality was not increased and probably decreased with the use of colloids in different forms of shock requiring early fluid resuscitation . We discussed herein some methodological issues that may explain the discrepancies of this trial with the other studies developed in the same field .',\n",
       " ' Cochlear implantation with the aim of hearing preservation for combined electric-acoustic stimulation ( EAS ) is the therapy of choice for patients with residual low-frequency hearing . Preserved residual acoustic hearing has a positive effect on speech intelligibility in difficult noise conditions . The goal of this study was to assess speech reception thresholds in various complex noise conditions for patients with EAS in comparison with patients using bilateral cochlear implants ( CI ) . Speech perception in noise was measured for bilateral CI and EAS patient groups . A total of 22 listeners with normal hearing served as a control group . Speech reception thresholds ( SRT ) were measured using a closed-set sentence matrix test . Speech was presented with a single source in frontal position ; noise was presented in frontal position or in a multisource noise field ( MSNF ) consisting of a four-loudspeaker array with independent noise sources . Modulated speech-simulating noise and pseudocontinuous noise served respectively as interference signal with different temporal characteristics . The average SRTs in the EAS group were significantly better in all test conditions than those of the group with bilateral CI . Both user groups showed significant improvement in the MSNF condition compared with the frontal noise condition as a result of bilateral interaction . The normal-hearing control group was able to use short temporal gaps in modulated noise to improve speech perception in noise ( gap listening ) . This effect was absent in both implanted user groups . Patients with combined EAS in one ear and a hearing aid in the contralateral ear show significantly improved speech perception in complex noise conditions compared with bilateral CI recipients .',\n",
       " ' Patient-reported outcomes ( PROs ) are particularly relevant in influenza vaccine trials in the elderly where reduction in symptom severity could prevent illness-related functional impairment . To evaluate PROs in people aged 65 years receiving two different vaccines . This was a phase III , randomised , observer-blind study ( NCT00753272 ) of the AS03-adjuvanted inactivated trivalent split-virion influenza vaccine ( AS03-TIV ) versus non-adjuvanted vaccine ( TIV ) . Using the FluiiQ questionnaire , symptom ( systemic , respiratory , total ) and life impact ( activities , emotions , relationships ) scores were computed as exploratory endpoints , with minimal important difference ( MID ) in influenza severity between vaccines considered post-hoc as > 7 % . Vaccine efficacy of AS03-TIV relative to TIV in severe influenza ( hospitalisation , complication , most severe one-third of episodes based on the area under the curve for systemic symptom score ) was calculated post-hoc . The main analyses ( descriptive ) were conducted in the according-to-protocol cohort ( n = 280 AS03-TIV , n = 315 TIV ) for influenza confirmed by culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . Mean systemic symptom , total symptom and impact on activities scores were lower with AS03-TIV versus TIV . Mean respiratory symptom , impact on emotions and impact on relationships scores were similar . Influenza tended to be less severe with AS03-TIV , but the MID was reached only for impact on activities ( mean 9.0 % ) . Relative vaccine efficacy in severe influenza was 29.38 % ( 95 % CI : 7.60-46 .02 ) . AS03-TIV had advantages over TIV in impact on systemic symptoms and activities as measured by the FluiiQ in elderly people . Higher efficacy of AS03-TIV relative to TIV was shown for prevention of severe illness .',\n",

In contrast , dietary patterns that include high intakes of refined grains , processed meats , and high amounts of added sugars have been associated with increased T2DM risk . This randomized , 2-period crossover trial compared the effects of dairy and sugar-sweetened product ( SSP ) consumption on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic - cell function in men and women at risk of the development of T2DM who habitually consume sugar-sweetened beverages . In a randomized , controlled crossover trial , participants consumed dairy products ( 474 mL/d 2 % milk and 170 g/d low-fat yogurt ) and SSPs ( 710 mL/d nondiet soda and 108 g/d nondairy pudding ) , each for 6 wk , with a 2-wk washout between treatments . A liquid meal tolerance test ( LMTT ) was administered at baseline and the end of each period . Participants were 50 % female with a mean age and body mass index of 53.8 y and 32.2 kg/m ( 2 ) , respectively . Changes from baseline were significantly different between dairy product and SSP conditions for median homeostasis model assessment 2-insulin sensitivity ( HOMA2 - % S ) ( 1.3 vs. -21.3 % , respectively , P = 0.009 ; baseline = 118 % ) , mean LMTT disposition index ( -0.03 vs. -0.36 , respectively , P = 0.011 ; baseline = 2.59 ) , mean HDL cholesterol ( 0.8 vs. -4.2 % , respectively , P = 0.015 ; baseline = 44.3 mg/dL ) , and mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] ( 11.7 vs. -3.3 , respectively , P = 0.022 ; baseline = 24.5 g/L ) .

We hypothesised that learning disabilities in NF1 children were related to ADHD symptoms . Treatment with methylphenidate ( MPD ) has improved learning disabilities in ADHD by acting on neurotransmitters . Our objective was to evaluate its efficacy on ADHD-like symptoms in neurofibromatosis type 1 children ( 7-12 years ) . This was a randomised , double blind , placebo controlled , and crossover trial comparing 0.5 to 0.8 mg/kg/d of MPD as it is indicated for ADHD to placebo in NF1 children with ADHD-like symptoms . Children aged 7 to 12years were eligible when their IQ was between 80 and 120 . The total follow-up was 9weeks including 4weeks for each period and 1week wash out . Fifty subjects ( 25 for each period ) were required for testing the primary study hypothesis . The main outcome was an improvement in scores on the simplified Conners ' Parent Rating Scale . Thirty-nine patients were included between April 2004 and December 2010 . Twenty participants received MPD and 19 placebo during the first period . They all completed the trial .

From January to December 2012 , 100 consecutive patients undergoing a liver resection were randomized to the radiofrequency vessel-sealing system ( LF1212 group ; N = 50 ) or to the clamp-crushing technique ( Kelly group , N = 50 ) . Background characteristics of the two groups were similar . There were not significant differences between the two groups in terms of blood loss , transection time and transection speed . In spite of a not-significant larger transection area in the LF1212 group compared with the Kelly group ( 51.5 versus 39cm ( 2 ) , P = 0.116 ) , the overall and ` per cm ( 2 ) ' blood losses were similar whereas the transection speed was better ( even if not significantly ) in the LF1212 group compared with the Kelly group ( 1.1 cm ( 2 ) / min versus 0.8 , P = 0.089 ) .

A total of 430 patients with CHB-related liver fibrosis were randomly assigned to treatment groups for receipt of a 12-month course of the antiviral drug entecavir alone ( control group ) or in combination with the TCM Liuweiwuling tablets . Patients were assessed before ( pre-treatment ) and after therapy and the treatment-related differences in clinical manifestations , levels of liver function markers and liver fibrosis indexes , color ultrasound images , and hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA load were compared between the two groups by statistical analysis . The generic QoL scale developed by the World Health Organization ( WHOQOL-BREF ) was used to score the patients ' perceptions of treatment outcome . After treatment , the patients in both groups showed significant improvement in the majority of clinical manifestations ( both P less than 0.05 ) , with the exception of bloating . In addition , both groups showed significant improvements of liver function markers and in signs of liver fibrosis ( both P less than 0.05 ) . Both groups also showed significant reductions in the diameters of the portal and splenic ( both P less than 0.05 ) , as well as increases in the rate of undetectable HBV DNA ( with a statistically similar outcome achieved in the two groups ) . Finally , both groups had higher QoL scores after treatment , with all assessed parameters except environment showing a significant improvement ( all P less than 0.05 ) . When used in combination with entecavir , the TCM Liuweiwuling tablet is a safe therapy for CHB and its related liver fibrosis and may help to improve the QoL of these patients .\",\n",

Responses of molecularly genotyped USH1 ( n = 18 ) and USH2 ( n = 24 ) subjects ( age range , 15-69 years ) were compared with those of controls ( n = 12 ) . A subset of USH1 ( n = 9 ) and USH2 ( n = 9 ) subjects was examined two to four times over 2 to 8 years . Photopic CxC ERG and conventional 30-Hz flicker ERG were recorded on the same visits . Usher syndrome subjects showed considerable cone flicker ERG amplitude losses and timing phase delays ( P < 0.01 ) compared with controls . USH1 and USH2 had similar rates of progressive logarithmic ERG amplitude decline with disease duration ( -0.012 log V/y ) . Of interest , ERG phase delays did not progress over time . Two USH1C subjects retained normal response timing despite reduced amplitudes . The CxC ERG method provided reliable responses in all subjects , whereas conventional ERG was undetectable in 7 of 42 subjects . Cycle-by-cycle ERG showed progressive loss of amplitude in both USH1 and USH2 subjects , comparable to that reported with psychophysical measures . Usher subjects showed abnormal ERG response latency , but this changed less than amplitude with time . In USH syndrome , CxC ERG is more sensitive than conventional ERG and warrants consideration as an outcome measure in USH treatment trials .',\n",

This was a single-center , openlabel , multiple-dose , two-period , complete crossover study that randomized healthy Japanese and , age and weight matched Caucasian subjects to QMF149 150/80 g or 150/320 g once daily ( o.d. ) for 14 days in each period . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) were assessed up to 24 hours on days 1 and 14 . 24 Japanese and 24 Caucasian healthy subjects were enrolled . Indacaterol and MF had similar PK profiles across both the doses and both ethnic groups . The maximum geometric mean ratios ( 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) ) for Japanese vs. Caucasian subjects for Cmax were 1.23 ( 1.11 - 1.38 ) and 1.24 ( 1.11 - 1.38 ) for indacaterol and MF , respectively . For AUC , the maximum ratios were 1.22 ( 1.09 - 1.36 ) and 1.30 ( 1.18 - 1.44 ) for indacaterol and MF , respectively . The mild trend towards higher exposure in Japanese subjects could be explained by the fact that the mean body weight was 14 % higher for Caucasians compared to their Japanese counterparts . No serious adverse events or discontinuations related to study medication were reported . The study demonstrated increase of mean exposure parameters in Japanese subjects vs. Caucasian subjects , which ranged between 19 - 23 % and 17 - 30 % , for indacaterol and MF components , respectively . Multiple doses of both the QMF149 dose levels were safe and well-tolerated in all subjects . Body weight was considered a key contributory factor for the observed difference in exposure . These results suggest no dose adjustment for QMF149 is required in Asian populations .',\n",

Subjects with acute exacerbation of asthma ( FEV1 < 50 % predicted following 30minof standardized treatment : 5mg nebulized albuterol ; 0.5-1 .5 mg nebulized ipratropium ; and 50mg oral prednisone ) were eligible . All subjects had % FEV1 and DS obtained at baseline and hourly for 3h . Using hospitalization/relapse as the outcome of interest ; we compared the area under the receiveroperator curves ( AUC ) between the 1 and 3hDS and % FEV1 measurements , and the AUC for the change in DS and % FEV1 between baseline and hour-3 . We determined ideal cut-points for % FEV1 and DS to maximize sensitivity and specificity . Sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values , and positive and negative likelihood ratios ( LR ) were compared between % FEV1 and DS . We developed a multivariate regression model examining the association of specific demographic and clinical variables to hospitalization/relapse . 142 patients were included for analysis . The AUC was greatest for the 3-hDS ( 0.721 ) , followed by the 3-h % FEV1 ( 0.669 ) . Optimum cut-off values were a DS of 2 , and an FEV1 of 42 % . These were associated with a + LR for the composite outcome of 3.06 and 2.48 respectively . Logistic regression showed baseline DS , 3-hDS , change in DS , and oxygen use at hour 3 were all associated with the composite outcome . The 3-hscore for % FEV1 and DS performed better than scores at any other time point and better than either parameter over time . The 3-hDS had the greatest association with the composite outcome . Neither test was a strong enough predictor to be used solely for this purpose .',\n",
       " ' Sarcopenia is currently best described as an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function . However , no consensus exists as to how to best quantify muscle function in older adults . The muscle quality index ( MQI ) was recently recommended as an ideal evidence-based assessment of functional status in older adults . Nevertheless , the usefulness of MQI to assess physical function is limited by whether it is reflective of muscle qualitative changes to an intervention . Thus , the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether MQI changes in response to resistance exercise training and detraining and how such changes correspond to other recommended measures of physical function proposed by suggested definitions of sarcopenia . Twenty-five older adults ( 70.66.1 y ; BMI = 28.15.4 kgm ( -2 ) ) completed a 6-week resistance training program in a wait-list controlled , cross-over design . MQI was determined as power output from timed sit to stand ( STS ) , body mass , and leg length . Gait speed , hand grip strength , get-up-and-go and lean body mass ( LBM ) were evaluated before and after exercise training and detraining . MQI and functional changes to training and detraining were evaluated with repeated measures ANOVA and clinical interpretations of magnitude based inferences . Short term resistance training significantly and clinically improved MQI ( 203.464.31 to 244.382.92 W ) , gait time ( 1.850.36 to 1.660.27 s ) and sit to stand performance ( 13.212.51 to 11.051.58 s ) .

       " ' The decreased number and senescence of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) are considered markers of vascular senescence associated with aging , atherosclerosis , and coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in elderly . In this study , we explore the role of vascular senescence in premature CAD ( PCAD ) in a developing country by comparing the numerical status and senescence of circulating EPCs in PCAD patients to controls . EPCs were measured by flow cytometry in 57 patients with angiographically documented CAD , and 57 controls without evidence of CAD , recruited from random patients 50 years of age at All India Institute of Medical Sciences . EPC senescence as determined by telomere length ( EPC-TL ) and telomerase activity ( EPC-TA ) was studied by real time polymerase chain reaction ( q PCR ) and PCR - ELISA respectively . The number of EPCs ( 0.18 % Vs. 0.039 % of total WBCs , p < 0.0001 ) , and EPC-TL ( 3.83 Vs. 5.10 kb/genome , p = 0.009 ) were markedly lower in PCAD patients compared to controls . These differences persisted after adjustment for age , sex , BMI , smoking and medications . EPC-TA was reduced in PCAD patients , but was statistically significant only after adjustment for confounding factors ( 1.81 Vs. 2.20 IU/cell , unadjusted p = 0.057 , adjusted p = 0.044 ) . We observed an association between increased vascular cell senescence with PCAD in a sample of young patients from India . This suggests that early accelerated vascular cell senescence may play an important mechanistic role in CAD epidemic in developing countries like India where PCAD burden is markedly higher compared to developed countries .',\n",
       " ' To compare the clinical efficacy differences between medicinal vesiculation combined with quick cupping at Shenque ( CV 8 ) and regular medication for allergic rhinitis with syndrome of yang deficiency . Eighty-two cases were randomly divided into an observation group ( 42 cases ) and a control group ( 40 cases ) . The observation group was treated with medicinal vesiculation combined with quick cupping at Shenque ( CV 8 ) . The medicinal vesiculation was applied at Feishu ( BL 13 ) , Gaohuang ( BL 43 ) , Fengmen ( BL 12 ) , Mingmen ( GV 4 ) on the dog days in the summer , one treatment on the 1st dog-day , 2nd dog-day and last dog-day respectively with an interval of 10 days between two treatments .

The quick cupping was applied at Shenque ( CV 8 ) , once a day , ten treatments were taken as one course , and totally three courses was given . The control group was treated with oral administration of loratadine and nasal spray of budesonide . The loratadine was given 10 mg per time , once a day for continuous 14 days ; budesonide was given once a day , ten treatments were taken as one course , and totally three courses was given . The clinical efficacy in two groups after treatment was observed , and the contents of immune globulin E ( IgE ) , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) and tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) in peripheral serum were measured before and after the treatments . Of all the 82 patients , 79 cases completed the treatment , and 1 patient in the observation group and 2 patients in the control group dropped out . The effective rate was 87.8 % ( 36/41 ) in the observation group , which was superior to 78.9 % ( 30/38 ) in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . After treatment , both groups effectively reduced the contents of IgE , IL-4 , IL-5 and TNF - , and the observation group had superior effect on reducing IgE and IL-4 to the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The medicinal vesiculation combined with quick cupping at Shenque ( CV 8 ) have better effect for allergic rhinitis with syndrome of yang deficiency than oral administration of loratadine and nasal spray of budesonide .',\n",
       " ' Tamsulosin and mirabegron may be used concomitantly in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms . Since alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists are associated with cardiovascular side effects , potential pharmacokinetic and cardiovascular interactions were evaluated . This was an open-label , randomized , 2-arm , 2-sequence study in 48 healthy men ( 24/arm ) aged 44 - 72 years . In arm 1 , subjects received single-dose tamsulosin hydrochloride modified release capsules ( 0.4 mg ) alone and with steady-state mirabegron oral controlled absorption system tablets ( 100 mg once daily ) in random sequence . In arm 2 , subjects received single-dose mirabegron alone and with steady-state tamsulosin . Samples for mirabegron and tamsulosin plasma concentrations were collected . Blood pressure ( BP ) and pulse rate ( PR ) were measured and orthostatic stress tests were performed . Mirabegron increased tamsulosin C ( max ) to 159 % ( 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) 143 - 177 % ) , AUC ( ) to 161 % ( 90 % CI 149 - 173 % ) , and t ( 1/2 ) to 116 % . Tamsulosin reduced mirabegron C ( max ) to 85 % ( 90 % CI 71 - 103 % ) and AUC ( ) to 84 % ( 90 % CI 74 - 95 % ) without effect on t1/2 . Mirabegron and tamsulosin co-treatment caused no statistically significant changes ( p > 0.05 ) in PR or systolic BP versus mono-treatment up to 12 hours post-dose . Mean diastolic BP decreases of -2.1 ( 95 % CI -4.1 , -0.1 ) to -4.2 ( -7.5 , -0.9 ) mmHg in arm 1 and -3.0 ( -5.7 , -0.3 ) to -4.2 ( -7.4 , -1.0 ) mmHg in arm 2 were observed , statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) at several time points , not accompanied by orthostatic symptoms or increases in positive orthostatic stress tests . Adverse and orthostatic events were balanced across treatments . The observed pharmacokinetic interactions upon add-on of mirabegron or tamsulosin to existing tamsulosin or mirabegron therapy did not cause clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular safety or safety profiles .',\n",

       " ' Obesity is associated with cardiometabolic disease , including insulin resistance ( IR ) and diabetes . Cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) signaling affects energy balance , IR , and glucose metabolism in experimental models . We sought to examine effects of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with tadalafil on IR in a pilot study of obese nondiabetic individuals . We conducted a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial of adults age 18 to 50 years with obesity and elevated fasting insulin levels ( 10 U/mL ) . Participants were randomized to tadalafil 20 mg daily or placebo for 3 months . Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed , and the effect of tadalafil on IR was examined . A total of 53 participants ( mean age , 33 years ; body mass index [ BMI ] , 38 kg/m ( 2 ) ) were analyzed , 25 randomized to tadalafil and 28 to placebo . In the overall sample , measures of IR did not differ between tadalafil and placebo groups at 3 months . However , in individuals with severe obesity ( BMI 36.2 kg/m ( 2 ) ) , tadalafil use was associated with improved IR ( homeostatic model assessment for IR ) , compared to placebo ( P = 0.02 , respectively ) . Furthermore , one measure of - cell compensation for IR ( oral disposition index ) improved with tadalafil in the overall sample ( P = 0.009 ) and in the subgroup with severe obesity ( P = 0.01 ) . Results of this pilot study did not show improvements in IR with tadalafil , compared to placebo . However , tadalafil may have favorable effects on - cell compensation , particularly in individuals with severe obesity . Future studies evaluating the potential metabolic benefits of cGMP modulation in obesity are warranted . ClinicalTrials.gov . Unique Identifier : NCT01444651 .',\n",
       " ' Inpatient medical settings offer an opportunistic environment for initiating smoking cessation interventions to patients reflecting on their health . Current evidence has shown the superior efficacy of varenicline tartrate ( VT ) for smoking cessation compared with other tobacco cessation therapies ; however , recent evidence also has highlighted concerns about the safety and tolerability of VT. . Given these apprehensions , we aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VT plus quitline-counseling compared to quitline-counseling alone in the inpatient medical setting . Adult patients ( n = 392 , 20-75 years ) admitted with a smoking-related illnesses to 3 hospitals were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of varenicline tartrate ( titrated from 0.5 mg daily to 1mg twice daily ) plus quitline-counseling ( VT+C ) , ( n = 196 ) or quitline-counseling alone ( n = 196 ) . VT was well tolerated in the inpatient setting among subjects admitted with acute smoking-related illnesses ( mean age 52.82.89 and 53.72.77 years in the VT+C and counseling alone groups , respectively ) . The most common self-reported adverse event during the 12-week treatment phase was nausea ( 16.3 % in the VT+C group compared with 1.5 % in the counseling alone group ) . Thirteen deaths occurred during the study period ( n = 6 were in the VT+C arm compared with n = 7 in the counseling alone arm ) . All of these subjects had known comorbidities or developed underlying comorbidities . VT appears to be a safe and well-tolerated opportunistic treatment for inpatient smokers who have related chronic disease . Based on the proven efficacy of varenicline from outpatient studies and our recent inpatient evidence , we suggest it be considered as part of standard care in the hospital setting .',\n",
       " ' Although the VITA 3D-Master ( 3D ) shade guide offers improved shade-matching performance , many dental materials are only available in VITA Classical ( VC ) shades . This study aimed to clarify whether it is possible to convert 3D shades determined by observers into VC shades ( indirect method ) without adding a clinically significant error in comparison with direct shade determination using the VC shade guide . Forty ceramic specimens were fabricated . L * a * b * values were recorded using a spectroradiometer . Sixty participants ( 35 dentists , 15 technicians , and 10 students ) were recruited and asked to determine the shades of specimens using the VC and 3D shade guides under standardized conditions . Conversion tables were constructed by allocating the closest VC shade tab to every matched 3D shade and by use of an optimization algorithm ( indirect methods ) . Differences between E values for VC matches and for the indirect methods were evaluated using t tests . A mean E ( SD ) of 4.34 ( 2.00 ) for VC and 4.22 ( 2.21 ) for 3D was observed ( P = .040 ) . Compared with direct shade matching using VC , the indirect method with the optimized tables resulted in a mean E of 4.32 ( 1.96 ) , which was not significantly different ( P = .586 ) . Within the limitations of this study , the conversion tables were suitable for the determination of tooth color using the 3D shade guide followed by conversion into VC shades without adding a clinically significant error .',\n",
       " ' It has been well documented that the maturing oocyte is very vulnerable to changes in its micro-environment , the follicular fluid ( FF ) . Recent research has focused on different components within this FF , like hormones , growth factors and metabolites , and how their concentrations are altered by diet and the metabolic health of the mother . It has been proposed that fatty acids ( FAs ) are potential factors that influence oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo development . However , a thorough study of the specific FF FA composition per lipid fraction and how this may be affected by BMI is currently lacking . Therefore , we investigated the BMI-related concentration of FAs in the phospholipid ( PL ) , cholesteryl-ester ( CHE ) , triglyceride ( TG ) and non-esterified ( NE ) lipid fraction in the FF of women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment ( ART ) . In this descriptive cross-sectional study , the FF of normal weight ( 18.5 BMI < 25.0 kg/m ( 2 ) , n = 10 ) , overweight ( 25.0 BMI < 30.0 kg/m ( 2 ) , n = 10 ) and obese ( BMI30 .0 kg/m ( 2 ) , n = 10 ) women , undergoing ART , was sampled and analyzed for 23 specific FAs in the PL , CHE , TG and NEFA fraction , using a gas chromatographic analysis method . Differences between BMI-groups were studied by means of univariate general linear models and post hoc Sheff tests . Total FA concentrations in the PL and CHE fraction did not differ between BMI groups . Total TG concentrations tended to differ and total NEFA concentrations differed significantly between BMI groups . Interestingly , 42 % and 34 % of the total FAs was esterified in the PL and CHE fraction , respectively , while only 10 % were present in both the TG and NEFA fraction . Only few individual FA concentrations differed in the PL , CHE and TG fraction between BMI groups , whereas abundant BMI-related differences were found in the NEFA fraction . Our data show that differences in BMI are associated with alterations in the FA composition of the FF , an effect most pronounced in the NEFA fraction . These BMI-related variations could possibly affect granulosa cell viability , oocyte developmental competence and subsequent embryo quality possibly explaining differences in oocyte quality in obese patients described by others .',\n",
       " \" To compare three children 's sodium fluoride toothpastes to placebo with respect to enamel remineralisation potential , enamel fluoride uptake and net acid resistance using an in situ palatal caries model in children aged 11-14 years following a single brushing . This was a randomised , single blind ( laboratory analyst ) , single-centre , four-treatment , crossover study with a 7-day washout period between treatments . The treatments were 1,426 ppm fluoride , 1,000 ppm fluoride , 500 ppm fluoride and 0 ppm fluoride ( placebo ) toothpaste ( NaF/silica ) . A custom made in situ palatal appliance was used by each subject in all treatment periods . At each of the four treatment visits subjects wore the appliance containing four partially demineralised human enamel specimens for 5 minutes and then brushed their teeth using a standardised procedure for 60 seconds under supervision using 1.0 g ( 0.1 g ) of their assigned toothpaste . After 4 hours the appliance was removed and enamel specimen recovered . This process was repeated until all subjects completed all four study treatment visits . Recovered enamel specimens were analysed for per cent surface microhardness recovery ( % SMHR ; Knoop ) and enamel fluoride uptake ( EFU ; microdrill biopsy ) . Subsequently , specimens were demineralised in vitro to determine their % net acid resistance ( % NAR ; Knoop ) . All three fluoride toothpastes demonstrated significantly greater % SMHR , EFU and % NAR compared with 0 ppm F toothpaste . The model demonstrated a dose response over the range 0 to 1,426 ppm fluoride for % SMHR , EFU and % NAR . There was no significant difference between 500 ppm F and 1,000 ppm F for % SMHR and between 1,000 ppm F and 1,426 ppm F for % SMHR , EFU and % NAR . The present in situ study demonstrated that the children 's fluoride toothpastes tested are capable of delivering cariostatic amounts of fluoride to early caries lesions following a single brushing .\",\n",

       " ' Abdominal obesity and exaggerated postprandial lipemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and mortality , and both are affected by dietary behavior . We investigated whether dietary supplementation with whey protein and medium-chain saturated fatty acids ( MC-SFAs ) improved postprandial lipid metabolism in humans with abdominal obesity . We conducted a 12-wk , randomized , double-blinded , diet intervention study . Sixty-three adults were randomly allocated to one of 4 diets in a 2 2 factorial design . Participants consumed 60 g milk protein ( whey or casein ) and 63 g milk fat ( with high or low MC-SFA content ) daily . Before and after the intervention , a high-fat meal test was performed . We measured changes from baseline in fasting and postprandial triacylglycerol , apolipoprotein B-48 ( apoB-48 ; reflecting chylomicrons of intestinal origin ) , free fatty acids ( FFAs ) , insulin , glucose , glucagon , glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , and gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) . Furthermore , changes in the expression of adipose tissue genes involved in lipid metabolism were investigated . Two-factor ANOVA was used to examine the difference between protein types and fatty acid compositions , as well as any interaction between the two . Fifty-two participants completed the study . We found that the postprandial apoB-48 response decreased significantly after whey compared with casein ( P = 0.025 ) independently of fatty acid composition . Furthermore , supplementation with casein resulted in a significant increase in the postprandial GLP-1 response compared with whey ( P = 0.003 ) . We found no difference in postprandial triacylglycerol , FFA , insulin , glucose , glucagon , or GIP related to protein type or MC-SFA content . We observed no interaction between milk protein and milk fat on postprandial lipemia . We found that a whey protein supplement decreased the postprandial chylomicron response compared with casein in persons with abdominal obesity , thereby indicating a beneficial impact on CVD risk .

       " ' Aging involves a progressive reduction of respiratory muscle strength as well as muscle strength . Compare the effects of resistance training volume on the maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) , maximum expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , functional performance , and muscle strength in elderly women . Thirty elderly women were randomly assigned to a group performing either single sets ( 1-SET ) or three sets ( 3-SET ) of exercises . The sit-to-stand test , MIP , MEP , and muscle strength were assessed before and after 24 training sessions . Progressive resistance training was performed two times per week for a total of 8-12 repetitions , using the main muscle groups of the upper and lower limbs . The main results showed that the participants significantly increased their MEP ( P < 0.05 ; 1-SET : 34.6 % ; 3-SET : 35.8 % ) and MIP ( P < 0.05 ; 1-SET : 13.7 % ; 3-SET : 11.2 % ) . Both groups also improved in the sit-to-stand test ( P < 0.05 ; 1-SET : 10.6 % ; 3-SET : 17.1 % ) . After 24 training sessions , muscle strength also significantly increased ( P < 0.0001 ; 40 % -80 % ) in both groups . An intergroup comparison did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the parameters analyzed . Single - and multiple-set resistance training programs increased MIP , MEP , muscle strength , and sit-to-stand test performance in elderly women after 24 sessions of training . In conclusion , our results suggested that elderly women who are not in the habit of physical activity may start with single-set resistance training programs as a short-term strategy for the maintenance of health .',\n",
       " \" Infliximab , a tumor necrosis factor antagonist , is effective for treating patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . We aimed to determine whether dosing based on therapeutic drug monitoring increases rate of remission and whether continued concentration-based dosing is superior to clinically based dosing of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with CD and UC . We performed a 1-year randomized controlled trial at a tertiary referral center , including 263 adults ( 178 with CD and 85 with UC ) with stable responses to maintenance infliximab therapy . Doses were escalated or reduced using an algorithm to reach a target trough concentration ( TC ) of 3-7 g/mL in all patients ( optimization phase ) . Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to groups that received infliximab dosing based on their clinical features ( n = 123 ) or continued dosing based on TCs ( n = 128 ) ( maintenance phase ) . The primary end point was clinical and biochemical remission at 1 year after the optimization phase . At screening , 115 of 263 patients had a TC of infliximab of 3-7 g/mL ( 43.7 % ) . Of 76 patients with TCs < 3 g/mL , 69 patients ( 91 % ) achieved TCs of 3-7 g/mL after dose escalation . This resulted in a higher proportion of CD patients in remission than before dose escalation ( 88 % vs 65 % ; P = .020 ) and a decrease in the median concentration of C-reactive protein , compared with before the dose increase ( 3.2 vs 4.3 mg/L ; P < .001 ) ; these changes were not observed in patients with UC . Of 72 patients with TCs > 7 g/mL , 67 patients ( 93 % ) achieved TCs of 3-7 g/mL after dose reduction . This resulted in a 28 % reduction in drug cost from before dose reduction ( P < .001 ) . Sixty-six percent of patients whose dosing was based on clinical features and 69 % whose dosing was based on TC achieved remission , the primary end point ( P = .686 ) . Disease relapsed in 21 patients who received clinically based dosing ( 17 % ) and 9 patients who received concentration-based dosing ( 7 % ) ( P = .018 ) . Targeting patients ' infliximab TCs to 3-7 g/mL results in a more efficient use of the drug . After dose optimization , continued concentration-based dosing was not superior to clinically based dosing for achieving remission after 1 year , but was associated with fewer flares during the course of treatment .

In this prospective , double-blind , single-site , randomized , and parallel-arm controlled trial , 60 children were assigned to undergo bilateral SMB with general anesthesia with either 0.15 ml/kg of 0.2 % ropivacaine ( Ropi group ) or 0.15 ml/kg of isotonic saline ( Saline group ) on each side . The primary endpoint was total postoperative morphine consumption at 48 h. Pain scores and respiratory - and SMB-related complications were noted . The overall dose of intravenous morphine after 48 h ( mean [ 95 % CI ] ) was lower in the Ropi group compared with that in the Saline group ( 104.3 [ 68.9 to 139.6 ] vs. 205.2 [ 130.7 to 279.7 ] g/kg ; P = 0.033 ) . Continuous morphine infusion was less frequent in the Ropi group compared with that in the Saline group ( 1 patient [ 3.6 % ] vs. 9 patients [ 31 % ] ; P = 0.006 ) . Three patients in the Saline group had an episode of oxygen desaturation requiring oxygen therapy . There were no technical failures or immediate complications of the SMB . Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters , doses of sufentanil , pain scores , and postoperative hydroxyzine requirements were not different between the two groups . Bilateral SMB is an easy regional anesthesia technique that reduces total morphine consumption at 48 h after cleft palate repair in children and the use of continuous infusion of morphine and may decrease postoperative respiratory complications .',\n",
       " ' To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AVP-825 , a drug-device combination of low-dose sumatriptan powder ( 22mg loaded dose ) delivered intranasally through a targeted Breath Powered device vs an identical device containing lactose powder ( placebo device ) in the treatment of migraine headache . Early treatment of migraine headaches is associated with improved outcome , but medication absorption after oral delivery may be delayed in migraineurs because of reduced gastric motility . Sumatriptan powder administered with an innovative , closed-palate , Bi-Directional , Breath Powered intranasal delivery mechanism is efficiently absorbed across the nasal mucosa and produces fast absorption into the circulation . Results from a previously conducted placebo-controlled study of AVP-825 showed a high degree of headache relief with an early onset of action ( eg , 74 % AVP-825 vs 38 % placebo device at 1 hour , P < .01 ) . In this double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study in adults with a history of migraine with or without aura , participants were randomized via computer-generated lists to AVP-825 or placebo device to treat a single migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity . The primary endpoint was headache relief ( defined as reduction of headache pain intensity from severe or moderate migraine headache to mild or none ) at 2 hours post-dose . Two hundred and thirty patients ( 116 AVP-825 and 114 placebo device ) were randomized , of whom 223 ( 112 and 111 , respectively ) experienced a qualifying migraine headache ( their next migraine headache that reached moderate or severe intensity ) . A significantly greater proportion of AVP-825 patients reported headache relief at 2 hours post-dose compared with those using the placebo device ( 68 % vs 45 % , P = .002 , odds ratio 2.53 , 95 % confidence interval [ 1.45 , 4.42 ] ) . Between-group differences in headache relief were evident as early as 15 minutes , reached statistical significance at 30 minutes post-dose ( 42 % vs 27 % , P = .03 ) , and were sustained at 24 hours ( 44 % vs 24 % , P = .002 ) and 48 hours ( 34 % vs 20 % , P = .01 ) . Thirty-four percent of patients treated with AVP-825 were pain-free at 2 hours compared with 17 % using the placebo device ( P = .008 ) . More AVP-825 patients reported meaningful pain relief ( patient interpretation ) of migraine within 2 hours of treatment vs placebo device ( 70 % vs 45 % , P < .001 ) , and fewer required rescue medication ( 37 % vs 52 % , P = .02 ) . Total migraine freedom ( patients with no headache , nausea , phonophobia , photophobia , or vomiting ) reached significance following treatment with AVP-825 at 1 hour ( 19 % vs 9 % ; P = .04 ) . There were no serious adverse events ( AEs ) , and no systemic AEs occurred in more than one patient . Chest pain or pressure was not reported , and only one patient taking AVP-825 reported mild paresthesia . No other triptan sensations were reported . Targeted delivery of a low-dose of sumatriptan powder via a novel , closed-palate , Breath Powered , intranasal device ( AVP-825 ) provided fast relief of moderate or severe migraine headache in adults that reached statistical significance over placebo by 30 minutes .

A randomized , double-blind , crossover study ( N = 30 ) was conducted , applying the euglycemic clamp technique over a period of 36 h. In this multiple-dose to steady-state study , participants received once-daily subcutaneous administrations of either 0.4 ( cohort 1 ) or 0.6 units kg ( -1 ) ( cohort 2 ) Gla-300 for 8 days in one treatment period and 0.4 units kg ( -1 ) Gla-100 for 8 days in the other . Here we focus on the results of a direct comparison between 0.4 units kg ( -1 ) of each treatment . PK and PD assessments performed on the last treatment day included serum insulin measurements using a radioimmunoassay and the automated euglycemic glucose clamp technique over 36 h. At steady state , insulin concentration ( INS ) and glucose infusion rate ( GIR ) profiles of Gla-300 were more constant and more evenly distributed over 24 h compared with those of Gla-100 and lasted longer , as supported by the later time ( 3 h ) to 50 % of the area under the serum INS and GIR time curves from time zero to 36 h post dosing . Tight blood glucose control ( 105 mg dL ( -1 ) ) was maintained for approximately 5 h longer ( median of 30 h ) with Gla-300 compared with Gla-100 . Gla-300 provides more even steady-state PK and PD profiles and a longer duration of action than Gla-100 , extending blood glucose control well beyond 24 h.',\n",
       " ' To evaluate intramuscular ketorolac compared with placebo saline injection for pain control with intrauterine device ( IUD ) placement . We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial between July 2012 and March 2014 . Patients received 30 mg ketorolac or placebo saline intramuscular injection 30 minutes before IUD placement . The primary outcome was pain with IUD placement on a 10-cm visual analog scale . Sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power to show a 2.0-cm difference ( = 0.05 ) in the primary outcome . Secondary outcomes included pain with study drug injection , speculum insertion , tenaculum placement , uterine sounding , and at 5 and 15 minutes after IUD placement . A total of 67 women participated in the study , 33 in the ketorolac arm and 34 in the placebo arm . There were no differences in baseline demographics including age , body mass index , and race . There were no differences in median pain scores for IUD placement in the placebo compared with ketorolac groups ( 5.2 compared with 3.6 cm , P = .99 ) . There was a decrease in median pain scores at 5 minutes ( 2.2 compared with 0.3 cm , P. 001 ) and 15 minutes ( 1.6 compared with 0.1 cm , P. 001 ) after IUD placement but no difference for all other time points . Nulliparous participants ( n = 16 , eight per arm ) had a decrease in pain scores with IUD placement ( 8.1 compared with 5.4 cm , P = .02 ) . In this study , 22 % of participants in the placebo group and 18 % in the ketorolac group reported injection pain was as painful as IUD placement .

       " ' To study activin signaling and its blockade in sporadic inclusion body myositis ( sIBM ) through translational studies and a randomized controlled trial . We measured transforming growth factor signaling by SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in muscle biopsies of 50 patients with neuromuscular disease ( 17 with sIBM ) . We tested inhibition of activin receptors IIA and IIB ( ActRII ) in 14 patients with sIBM using one dose of bimagrumab ( n = 11 ) or placebo ( n = 3 ) . The primary outcome was the change in right thigh muscle volume by MRI at 8 weeks . Lean body mass , strength , and function were secondary outcomes . Twelve of the patients ( 10 bimagrumab , 2 placebo ) participated in a subsequent 16-week observation phase . Muscle SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was higher in sIBM than in other muscle diseases studied ( p = 0.003 ) . Eight weeks after dosing , the bimagrumab-treated patients increased thigh muscle volume ( right leg +6.5 % compared with placebo , p = 0.024 ; left leg +7.6 % , p = 0.009 ) and lean body mass ( +5.7 % compared with placebo , p = 0.014 ) . Subsequently , bimagrumab-treated patients had improved 6-minute walking distance , which peaked at 16 weeks ( +14.6 % , p = 0.008 ) compared with placebo . There were no serious adverse events ; the main adverse events with bimagrumab were mild acne and transient involuntary muscle contractions . Transforming growth factor superfamily signaling , at least through ActRII , is implicated in the pathophysiology of sIBM . Inhibition of ActRII increased muscle mass and function in this pilot trial , offering a potential novel treatment of sIBM . This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with inclusion body myositis , bimagrumab increases thigh muscle volume at 8 weeks .',\n",
       " \" Although dental care settings provide an exceptional opportunity to reach smokers and provide brief cessation advice and treatment to reduce oral and other tobacco-related health conditions , dental care providers demonstrate limited adherence to evidence-based guidelines for treatment of tobacco use and dependence . Guided by a multi-level , conceptual framework that emphasizes changes in provider beliefs and organizational characteristics as drivers of improvement in tobacco treatment delivery , the current protocol will use a cluster , randomized design and multiple data sources ( patient exit interviews , provider surveys , site observations , chart audits , and semi-structured provider interviews ) to study the process of implementing clinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco dependence in 18 public dental care clinics in New York City . The specific aims of this comparative-effectiveness research trial are to : compare the effectiveness of three promising strategies for implementation of tobacco use treatment guidelines-staff training and current best practices ( CBP ) , CBP + provider performance feedback ( PF ) , and CBP+PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment ( pay-for-performance , or P4P ) ; examine potential theory-driven mechanisms hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation ; and identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics . The primary outcome is change in providers ' tobacco treatment practices and the secondary outcomes are cost per quit , use of tobacco cessation treatments , quit attempts , and smoking abstinence . We hypothesize that the value of these promising implementation strategies is additive and that incorporating all three strategies ( CBP , PF , and P4P ) will be superior to CBP alone and CBP+PF in improving delivery of cessation assistance to smokers . The findings will improve knowledge pertinent to the implementation , dissemination , and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment in dental practices . NCT01615237 .\",\n",
       " ' Multicenter , randomized , controlled trial on preoperative pain neuroscience education ( NE ) for lumbar radiculopathy . To determine if the addition of NE to usual preoperative education would result in superior outcomes with regard to pain , function , surgical experience , and health care utilization postsurgery . One in 4 patients after lumbar surgery ( LS ) for radiculopathy experience persistent pain and disability , which is nonresponsive to perioperative treatments . NE focusing on the neurophysiology of pain has been shown to decrease pain and disability in populations with chronic low back pain . Eligible patients scheduled for LS for radiculopathy were randomized to receive either preoperative usual care ( UC ) or a combination of UC plus 1 session of NE delivered by a physical therapist ( verbal one-on-one format ) and a NE booklet . Sixty-seven patients completed the following outcomes prior to LS ( baseline ) , and 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after LS : low back pain ( numeric rating scale ) , leg pain ( numeric rating scale ) , function ( Oswestry Disability Index ) , various beliefs and experiences related to LS ( 10-item survey with Likert scale responses ) , and postoperative utilization of health care ( utilization of health care questionnaire ) . At 1-year follow-up , there were no statistical differences between the experimental and control groups with regard to primary outcome measure of low back pain ( P = 0.183 ) , leg pain ( P = 0.075 ) , and function ( P = 0.365 ) . In a majority of the categories regarding surgical experience , the NE group scored significantly better : better prepared for LS ( P = 0.001 ) ; preoperative session preparing them for LS ( P < 0.001 ) and LS meeting their expectations ( P = 0.021 ) . Health care utilization post-LS also favored the NE group ( P = 0.007 ) resulting in 45 % less health care expenditure compared with the control group in the 1-year follow-up period . NE resulted in significant behavior change . Despite a similar pain and functional trajectory during the 1-year trial , patients with LS who received NE viewed their surgical experience more favorably and used less health care facility in the form of medical tests and treatments . 2 .',\n",

The present study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted at a university hospital in Egypt during 2012-2013 , and included women with an indication for cesarean delivery . Extra-abdominal repair was used in group 1 ( n = 500 ) and in situ repair in group 2 ( n = 500 ) . The primary outcome measure was the surgery duration . Surgery duration was significantly longer in group 1 than group 2 ( 49.92.3 minutes vs 39.91.8 minutes ; P < 0.001 ) . More patients in group 1 than in group 2 had postoperative moderate-to-severe pain ( 165 [ 33.0 % ] vs 115 [ 23.0 % ] ; P = 0.001 ) and needed additional postoperative analgesia ( 100 [ 20.0 % ] vs 50 [ 10.0 % ] ; P < 0.001 ) . Moreover , mean time to bowel movement was longer in group 1 than in group 2 ( 17.02.7 hours vs 14.01.9 hours ; P < 0.001 ) .

Patients diagnosed with gynecologic cancer undergoing primary major surgery between 2010 and 2011 in our institute were randomized to receive LMWH+GCS or GCS as VTE prophylaxis post-operatively . Altogether 247 patients were enrolled . The incidence of VTE in patients treated with LMWH + GCS was significantly lower than that in patients using GCS alone ( 0.8 % Vs. 8.1 % , P = 0.01 ) . There were no severe bleeding complications in the patients with prophylactic use of LMWH and the occurrence rate of wound dehiscence was comparable between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) . Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that age over 60 years ( P = 0.015 ) , duration of operation over 3 hours ( P = 0.04 ) and without prophylactic use of LMWH ( P = 0.02 ) were independent risk factors for VTE . Dual prophylaxis with LMWH and GCS should be recommended for gynecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery for its better efficacy than GCS . Prophylactic use of LMWH is safe and convenient . Patients with older age and prolonged operation time are at highest risk of developing VTE post-operatively .',\n",
       " ' Until recently , very few intervention studies have investigated the effects of whole-grain cereals on postprandial glucose , insulin and lipid metabolism , and the existing studies have provided mixed results . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 12-week intervention with either a whole-grain-based or a refined cereal-based diet on postprandial glucose , insulin and lipid metabolism in individuals with metabolic syndrome . Sixty-one men and women age range 40-65 years , with the metabolic syndrome were recruited to participate in this study using a parallel group design . After a 4-week run-in period , participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week diet based on whole-grain products ( whole-grain group ) or refined cereal products ( control group ) . Blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of the intervention , both fasting and 3 h after a lunch , to measure biochemical parameters . Generalized linear model ( GLM ) was used for between-group comparisons . Overall , 26 participants in the control group and 28 in the whole-grain group completed the dietary intervention . Drop-outs ( five in the control and two in the whole-grain group ) did not affect randomization . After 12 weeks , postprandial insulin and triglyceride responses ( evaluated as average change 2 and 3 h after the meal , respectively ) decreased by 29 % and 43 % , respectively , in the whole-grain group compared to the run-in period . Postprandial insulin and triglyceride responses were significantly lower at the end of the intervention in the whole-grain group compared to the control group ( p = 0.04 and p = 0.05 ; respectively ) whereas there was no change in postprandial response of glucose and other parameters evaluated . A twelve week whole-grain cereal-based diet , compared to refined cereals , reduced postprandial insulin and triglycerides responses . This finding may have implications for type 2 diabetes risk and cardiovascular disease .',\n",
       " \" Oral ulcers , the hallmark of Behet 's syndrome , can be resistant to conventional treatment ; therefore , alternative agents are needed . Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that modulates several inflammatory pathways . We conducted a phase 2 , multicenter , placebo-controlled study in which 111 patients with Behet 's syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks . This regimen was followed by a 12-week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28-day post-treatment observational follow-up phase . The patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial . The primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week 12 . Secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers ( measured on a 100-mm visual-analogue scale , with higher scores indicating worse pain ) , the number of genital ulcers , overall disease activity , and quality of life . The mean ( SD ) number of oral ulcers per patient at week 12 was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group ( 0.51.0 vs. 2.12.6 ) ( P < 0.001 ) . The mean decline in pain from oral ulcers from baseline to week 12 was greater with apremilast than with placebo ( -44.724.3 mm vs. -16.032.5 mm ) ( P < 0.001 ) . Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea were more common in the apremilast group ( with 22 , 9 , and 12 incidents , respectively , among 55 patients ) than in the placebo group ( with 10 , 1 , and 2 incidents , respectively , among 56 patients ) , findings that were similar to those in previous studies of apremilast . There were two serious adverse events in patients receiving apremilast . Apremilast was effective in treating oral ulcers , which are the cardinal manifestation of Behet 's syndrome .

       " ' Leg compression is considered basic treatment for superficial vein thrombosis ( SVT ) , although scientific proof for its efficacy is lacking . The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of compression stockings on isolated SVT of the legs . This was a single-center randomized controlled trial . Eighty patients with isolated SVT of the legs were instructed to wear compression stockings ( 23-32mmHg ) ( CG ) or no compression ( NCG ) for 3 weeks . All patients received low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) at prophylactic dosage . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) were allowed . The primary outcome variable was the reduction of pain as assessed by a visual analog scale ( VAS ) and the Lowenberg test . Secondary outcomes were the consumption of analgesics , thrombus length , skin erythema , D-dimer , and quality of life ( QoL ) . Seventy-three patients completed the study . Clinical symptoms and QoL significantly improved from baseline to day 21 in both groups ( p < .001 for VAS , Lowenberg test , thrombus length , and erythema ; p < .006 for QoL ) , and consumption of analgesics and D-dimer significantly decreased ( p < .001 ) . There was no significant difference between the groups for all tested variables . At day 7 , patients in the CG revealed a significantly faster thrombus regression ( p = .02 ) . Adding compression stockings for 3 weeks to LMWH and NSAIDs does not bring significant additional benefit in the treatment of isolated SVT . When worn for 1 week , compression stockings stimulate significantly faster thrombus regression .',\n",

We therefore tested whether hammock sleep affected oxygenation in infants , when they were at an age of high risk of sudden , unexpected infant death . Healthy , full-term 4 - to 8-week-old infants were randomised to sleep either in a commercially available hammock ( n = 14 ) or a standard bassinet ( n = 9 ) , and sleep state , oxygen desaturation ( a fall in peripheral haemoglobin oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) 4 % , for 4 sec from baseline to nadir ) , apnoea and hypopnoea , and mean SpO2 were analysed . There was no significant difference in mean SpO2 ( both 98.5 % ) or rate of oxygen desaturation events between the hammock and the bassinet cot ( mean SD , 24 20 vs. 28 23 events per hour ) , but infants slept less in the hammock ( 59 31 vs. 81 34 min , p < 0.02 ) . When correctly used , the hammock sleep position did not compromise the upper airway of sleeping infants . The significance of shorter duration of sleep in the hammocks is unclear . These findings should not be applied to all baby hammocks , nor to older babies , particularly once the infant can roll . Given that it is not possible to predict when an infant will be able to roll , we strongly recommend that hammocks should not be used for unsupervised sleep .',\n",

Demographic differences between the test two groups were determined by Student 's t-test or Fisher exact ( 95 % CI ; p > 0.05 ) . Association and correlation between the responses of G-pp/ol and G-ol/pp were assessed for each sample by the t-test and Pearson 's coefficient . An identical strategy was used for intragroup comparisons . A total of 273 women participated in the study and 28 ( 10.2 % ) giving up the second collection . There were no demographic differences between groups . Fifteen of the 19 FSFI questions were associated and correlated between the two groups in both test and the retest . The intragroup analysis revealed that all FSFI questions and scores were associated and weakly correlated for the same group during both test and retest . The online version of the FSFI showed acceptable validity and reliability when compared to the paper version , and can justify the choice of this modality , especially in studies involving private questions .\",\n",

One hundred and seventeen displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures in 108 patients from January 2007 and September 2010 were randomly allocated to receive routine treatment ( 49 patients ) or minimally invasive treatment ( 59 patients ) . Operative time , preoperative and postoperative calcaneal height , width , length , Bhlers angle , Gissanes angle , and incision healing were recorded . Maryland foot score system was used to evaluate clinical functional outcomes . The operative time of minimally invasive group was significantly shorter than that of the routine group [ 46-80 min ( mean , 62 min ) vs 65-110 min ( mean , 93 min ) , p < 0.01 ] . Postoperative X-ray showed the calcaneal height , width , length , Bhlers angle and Gissanes angle were significantly improved in both two groups , and no significant difference was observed between two groups postoperatively . No feet developed wound complications in minimally invasive group , but incision complications occurred in 8 feet in routine group . The excellent and good rate according to the Maryland foot score was significantly higher in minimally invasive group than that in the routine group ( 93.8 % vs 86.8 % ) . Compared with L-shaped lateral approach treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures , sinus tarsi approach for the reduction and internal fixation with percutaneous plate seems to be more safe and effective , with satisfactory clinical therapeutic effects and without postoperative complications .',\n",
       " ' The incidence of acute kidney injury ( AKI ) is estimated at 10 to 20 % in patients admitted to intensive care units ( ICU ) and often requires renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . ICU mortality in AKI patients can exceed 50 % . Venous catheters are the preferred vascular access method for AKI patients requiring RRT , but carry a risk of catheter thrombosis or infection . Catheter lock solutions are commonly used to prevent such complications . Heparin and citrate locks are both widely used for tunneled , long-term catheters , but few studies have compared citrate versus heparin for patients with short-term , non-tunneled catheters . We aim to compare citrate 4 % catheter lock solution versus heparin in terms of event-free survival of the first non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter inserted in ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT . Secondary objectives are the rate of fibrinolysis , incidence of catheter thrombosis and catheter-related infection per 1,000 catheter days , length of stay in ICU and in-hospital and 28-day mortality . The VERROU-REA study is a randomized , prospective , multicenter , double-blind , parallel-group , controlled superiority study carried out in the medical , surgical and nephrological ICUs of two large university hospitals in eastern France . A catheter lock solution composed of trisodium citrate at 4 % will be compared to unfractionated heparin at a concentration of 5,000 IU/mL . All consecutive adult patients with AKI requiring extracorporeal RRT , and in whom a first non-tunneled catheter is to be inserted by the jugular or femoral approach , will be eligible . Catheters inserted by the subclavian approach , patients with acute liver failure , thrombopenia or contraindication to systemic anticoagulation will be excluded . Patients will be followed up daily in accordance with standard practices for RRT until death or discharge . Data is scarce regarding the use of non-tunneled catheters in the ICU setting in patients with AKI .

       " \" Paradoxically , a breast cancer risk reduction with conjugated equine estrogens ( CEE ) and a risk elevation with CEE plus medroxyprogesterone acetate ( CEE+MPA ) were observed in the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) randomized controlled trials . The effects of hormone therapy on serum sex hormone levels , and on the association between baseline sex hormones and disease risk , may help explain these divergent breast cancer findings . Serum sex hormone concentrations were measured for 348 breast cancer cases in the CEE+MPA trial and for 235 cases in the CEE trial along with corresponding pair-matched controls , nested within the WHI trials of healthy postmenopausal women . Association and mediation analyses , to examine the extent to which sex hormone levels and changes can explain the breast cancer findings , were conducted using logistic regression . Following CEE treatment , breast cancer risk was associated with higher concentrations of baseline serum estrogens , and with lower concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin . However , following CEE+MPA , there was no association of breast cancer risk with baseline sex hormone levels . The sex hormone changes from baseline to year 1 provided an explanation for much of the reduced breast cancer risk with CEE . Specifically , the treatment odds ratio ( 95 % confidence interval ) increased from 0.71 ( 0.43 , 1.15 ) to 0.92 ( 0.41 , 2.09 ) when the year 1 measures were included in the logistic regression analysis . In comparison , the CEE+MPA odds ratio was essentially unchanged when these year 1 measures were included . Breast cancer risk remains low following CEE use among women having favorable baseline sex hormone profiles , but CEE+MPA evidently produces a breast cancer risk for all women similar to that for women having an unfavorable baseline sex hormone profile . These patterns could reflect breast ductal epithelial cell stimulation by CEE+MPA that is substantially avoided with CEE , in conjunction with relatively more favorable effects of either regimen following a sustained period of estrogen deprivation . These findings may have implications for other hormone therapy formulations and routes of delivery . clinicaltrials.gov identifier : NCT00000611 .\",\n",

By spring of 12th grade , students in CTC communities were more likely than students in control communities to have abstained from any drug use ( adjusted risk ratio [ ARR ] = 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 1.06-1 .63 ) , drinking alcohol ( ARR = 1.31 ; 95 % CI , 1.09-1 .58 ) , smoking cigarettes ( ARR = 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 1.01-1 .27 ) , and engaging in delinquency ( ARR = 1.18 ; 95 % CI , 1.03-1 .36 ) . They were also less likely to ever have committed a violent act ( ARR = 0.86 ; 95 % CI , 0.76-0 .98 ) . There were no significant differences by intervention group in targeted risks , the prevalence of past-month or past-year substance use , or past-year delinquency or violence . Using the CTC system continued to prevent the initiation of adolescent problem behaviors through 12th grade , 8 years after implementation of CTC and 3 years after study-provided resources ended , but did not produce reductions in current levels of risk or current prevalence of problem behavior in 12th grade .

       " ' In some randomized controlled trials laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) for acute cholecystitis was associated with a shorter hospital stay when compared with open cholecystectomy ( OC ) . These studies were not double blinded and without intention to treat purpose . The present study project was a prospective , randomized investigation . The study was performed in the Department of General , Emergency and Transplant Surgery St Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital ( Bologna , Italy ) . Subjects were divided in two groups : in the first group the patient was submitted to LC while in the second group was submitted to OC . Of 164 consecutive patients , 20 were excluded from the study . The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics . Seven ( 9.7 % ) patients in the LC group required conversion to OC . There were no deaths or bile duct lesions in either group , and the postoperative complication rate was similar ( p = n.s. ) . The mean postoperative hospital stay was also comparable . Even though LC for acute and gangrenous cholecystitis is technically demanding , in experienced hands it is safe and effective . It does not increase the mortality and the morbidity rate with a low conversion rate and no difference in hospital stay .',\n",
       " ' The role of three factors in drinking outcome after brief intervention among heavily drinking HIV patients were investigated : strength of commitment to change drinking , alcohol dependence , and treatment type : brief Motivational Interview ( MI ) only , or MI plus HealthCall , a technological extension of brief intervention . HIV primary care patients ( N = 139 ) who drank 4 drinks at least once in the 30 days before study entry participated in MI-only or MI+H ealthCall in a randomized trial to reduce drinking . Patients were 95.0 % minority ; 23.0 % female ; 46.8 % alcohol dependent ; mean age 46.3 . Outcome at end of treatment ( 60 days ) was drinks per drinking day ( Timeline Follow-Back ) . Commitment strength ( CS ) was rated from MI session recordings . Overall , stronger CS predicted end-of-treatment drinking ( p < .001 ) . After finding an interaction of treatment , CS and alcohol dependence ( p = .01 ) , we examined treatmentCS interactions in alcohol dependent and non-dependent patients . In alcohol dependent patients , the treatmentcommitment strength interaction was significant ( p = .006 ) ; patients with low commitment strength had better outcomes in MI+H ealthCall than in MI-only ( lower mean drinks per drinking day ; 3.5 and 4.6 drinks , respectively ) . In non-dependent patients , neither treatment nor CS predicted outcome . Among alcohol dependent HIV patients , HealthCall was most beneficial in drinking reduction when MI ended with low commitment strength . HealthCall may not merely extend MI effects , but add effects of its own that compensate for low commitment strength . Thus , HealthCall may also be effective when paired with briefer interventions requiring less skill , training and supervision than MI . Replication is warranted .',\n",

The primary outcome measures were new incidences of alcohol ( life-time and 1-month prevalence ) , tobacco ( life-time and 1-month prevalence ) and marijuana use ( life-time prevalence ) . Main effect analyses showed no programme effects on incidences of alcohol consumption ( life-time prevalence : e-learning condition : B = 0.102 , P = 0.549 ; integral condition : B = -0.157 , P = 0.351 ; 1-month prevalence : e-learning condition : B = 0.191 , P = 0.288 ; integral condition : B = -0.140 , P = 0.445 ) , tobacco consumption ( life-time prevalence : e-learning condition : B = 0.164 , P = 0.444 ; integral condition : B = 0.160 , P = 0.119 ; 1-month prevalence : e-learning condition : B = 0.088 , P = 0.746 ; integral condition : B = 0.261 , P = 0.093 ) , or marijuana consumption ( life-time prevalence : e-learning condition : B = 0.070 , P = 0.732 ; integral condition : B = 0.186 , P = 0.214 ) . The non-significant impact of the Healthy School and Drugs programme ( a Dutch school-based prevention programme for early adolescents ) on incidences of alcohol , tobacco and marijuana use indicates that the programme is either ineffective or implemented inadequately .',\n",
       " ' Esophageal resection is associated with a high incidence of postoperative pneumonia . Respiratory complications account for almost half of the readmissions to the critical care unit . Postoperative complications can result in prolonged hospital stay and consequently increase healthcare costs . In cardiac surgery a preoperative inspiratory muscle training program has shown to prevent postoperative pneumonia and reduce length of hospital stay . While in some surgical centers inspiratory muscle training is already used in the preoperative phase in patients undergoing esophageal resection , the added value of this intervention on the reduction of pulmonary complications has not yet been investigated in large surgical populations other than cardiac surgery in a randomized and controlled study design . The effect of a preoperative inspiratory muscle training program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal resection will be studied in a single blind multicenter randomized controlled trial ( the PREPARE study ) . In total 248 patients ( age > 18years ) undergoing esophageal resection for esophageal cancer will be included in this study . They are randomized to either usual care or usual care with an additional inspiratory muscle training intervention according to a high-intensity protocol which is performed with a tapered flow resistive inspiratory loading device . Patients have to complete 30 dynamic inspiratory efforts twice daily for 7days a week until surgery with a minimum of 2weeks . The starting training load will be aimed to be 60 % of maximal inspiratory pressure and will be increased based on the rate of perceived exertion.The main study endpoint is the incidence of postoperative pneumonia . Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of preoperative inspiratory muscle training on length of hospital stay , duration of mechanical ventilation , incidence of other postoperative ( pulmonary ) complications , quality of life , and on postoperative respiratory muscle function and lung function . The PREPARE study is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the hypothesis that preoperative inspiratory muscle training leads to decreased pulmonary complications in patients undergoing esophageal resection .

       " ' Few data are available on the influence of a colonoscope length for trainees , which could affect both the duration of training and colonoscopy quality . We conducted this study to validate which scope needs more duration for training to reach technical competence and to shows better quality indicators during diagnostic colonoscopy . We conducted a prospective randomly assigned study from April 2010 to February 2011 at Asan Medical Center . Among the 1329 patients enrolled , 1200 colonoscopies were analyzed . We compared cecal intubation rate , adenoma detection rate , cecal intubation time ( < 20 min ) , and withdrawal time between the trainees using the intermediate-length colonoscope and those using long-length colonoscope . Trainees who used the long-length colonoscope showed a higher overall cecal intubation rate ( 88.2 % vs. 81.0 % , p = 0.001 ) and adenoma detection rate ( 49.7 % vs. 34.2 % , p < 0.001 ) than those using the intermediate-length colonoscope . The successful cecal intubation rate improved significantly and reached the requisite standard of competence ( > 90 % ) after 90 procedures in the long-length colonoscope group . However , the trainees using the intermediate-length colonoscope reached the requisite standard of competence after 150 procedures . Logistic regression analysis revealed that prolonged cecal intubation was associated with the use of the intermediate-length colonoscope , poor colon preparation , a small number of esophagastroduodenoscopy or sigmoidoscopy procedures conducted , and pain during procedures . During the same training period , use of the long-length colonoscope in trainee was better in terms of reaching competency and quality indicators , and was less painful for the patients during colonoscopic procedures .',\n",
       " ' The current study was performed to investigate the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) eating plan on pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) . This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed among 52 women diagnosed with GDM . Participants were randomly assigned to consume either the control ( n = 26 ) or the DASH diet ( n = 26 ) for 4 weeks . The control diet was designed to contain 45-55 % carbohydrates , 15-20 % protein and 25-30 % total fat . The DASH diet was rich in fruits , vegetables , whole grains and low-fat dairy products , and contained lower amounts of saturated fats , cholesterol and refined grains with a total of 2400 mg/day sodium . The numbers of women who commenced insulin therapy after dietary intervention , the mode of delivery and prevalence of polyhydramnios were assessed . The length , weight and head circumference of infants were measured during the first 24 h after birth . Whereas 46.2 % of women in the DASH diet needed to have a cesarean section , this percentage for the control group was 80.8 % ( P = 0.01 ) . The percentage of those who needed to commence insulin therapy after intervention was also significantly different between the two groups ( 23 % for DASH vs 73 % for control group , P < 0.0001 ) . Infants born to mothers on the DASH diet had significantly lower weight ( 3222.7 vs 3818.8 g , P < 0.0001 ) , head circumference ( 34.2 vs 35.1 cm , P = 0.01 ) and ponderal index ( 2.50 vs 2.87 kg/m ( 3 ) , P < 0.0001 ) compared with those born to mothers on the control diet . In conclusion , consumption of DASH diet for 4 weeks among pregnant women with GDM resulted in improved pregnancy outcomes .',\n",
       " ' Functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) is an emerging technique for the in vivo assessment of functional activity of the cerebral cortex as well as in the field of brain-computer interface ( BCI ) research . A common challenge for the utilization of fNIRS in these areas is a stable and reliable investigation of the spatio-temporal hemodynamic patterns . However , the recorded patterns may be influenced and superimposed by signals generated from physiological processes , resulting in an inaccurate estimation of the cortical activity . Up to now only a few studies have investigated these influences , and still less has been attempted to remove/reduce these influences . The present study aims to gain insights into the reduction of physiological rhythms in hemodynamic signals ( oxygenated hemoglobin ( oxy-Hb ) , deoxygenated hemoglobin ( deoxy-Hb ) ) . We introduce the use of three different signal processing approaches ( spatial filtering , a common average reference ( CAR ) method ; independent component analysis ( ICA ) ; and transfer function ( TF ) models ) to reduce the influence of respiratory and blood pressure ( BP ) rhythms on the hemodynamic responses . All approaches produce large reductions in BP and respiration influences on the oxy-Hb signals and , therefore , improve the contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) . In contrast , for deoxy-Hb signals CAR and ICA did not improve the CNR . However , for the TF approach , a CNR-improvement in deoxy-Hb can also be found . The present study investigates the application of different signal processing approaches to reduce the influences of physiological rhythms on the hemodynamic responses . In addition to the identification of the best signal processing method , we also show the importance of noise reduction in fNIRS data .',\n",
       " ' To study effect of combined therapy with amlodipine with ramipril on the circadian profile of arterial pressure in patients with arterial hypertension in the Far North depending on the shiftwork regime . 130 patients with grade 2-3 AH were divided into 2 groups depending on the work-time schedule . Group 1 included 67 daywork patients group 2 consisted of 63 patients working in the alternating daywork and nightwork regime . 24 hr AH monitoring was performed before , 4 weeks and 6 months after the onset of the study . Six months after the onset of therapy practically all patients reached the target AD level ( 94.4 % in group 1 and 94.7 % in group ) . The patients fairly well tolerated therapy AD circadian profile was normalized 1.9 times in group 1 and 3.2 times in group 2 . Recovered AP variability in group 1 resulted in a decreased frequency of target organ affection . In group 2 , the initially higher variability accounted for the normalization of only diastolic AP variability after 6 month therapy . It suggests the necessity of prescription of a third anti-AH preparation to these patients . Morning AP dynamics improved in both groups .',\n",
       " ' To ( 1 ) develop a model of cyclical adduction force on an abducted left arytenoid cartilage that mimics swallowing or coughing ; ( 2 ) determine if arytenoid abduction by a clamp before knot tying will improve the maintenance of abduction under cyclical adduction testing . Experimental . Cadaveric equine larynges ( n = 14 ) . Left laryngoplasty performed using a single suture of # 5 Ethibond with ( n = 7 ) and without ( n = 7 ) abducting the arytenoid with a clamp before knot tying . Each laryngoplasty was loaded cyclically from 2 to 26N at 0.5 Hz for 5000 cycles in a servohydraulic test frame . Arytenoid displacement data were collected at 1Hz intervals and median percent loss of abduction compared between groups . Significance was set at P < .05 . Median left arytenoid abduction distance was 16.9 mm ( range , 9.8-19 .8 mm ) . One larynx in each group failed at < 1000 cycles . Loss of abduction was determined by progressive displacement of the testing actuator and confirmed by measurement . There was no difference in loss of abduction between clamped and non-clamped larynges after 5000 cycles . This model of cyclical adduction resulted in arytenoid displacements similar to those seen in the 1st week postoperatively . Ex vivo cyclical adductory forces produced a significant loss of laryngoplasty abduction . The use of a clamp to abduct the arytenoid cartilage before knot tying did not reduce the loss of abduction .',\n",

One double-blind , randomized , vehicle-controlled study ( study 1 ) and two open-label studies ( studies 2 and 3 ) examined the efficacy , safety , and optimal dosing concentration of tavaborole topical solution applied once daily or three times weekly for 180 days at concentrations of 1.0 % , 2.5 % , 5.0 % , or 7.5 % . Patient cohort 3 of study 2 received open-label tavaborole 5.0 % once daily for 360 days . All three studies assessed day 180 treatment success , defined as complete or partial clinical evidence of clear nail growth plus negative fungal culture . A total of 336 patients were included in the intent-to-treat ( ITT ) or modified ITT populations and efficacy analyses across the 3 studies . In study 1 , treatment success rates at day 180 were higher with tavaborole 2.5 % , 5.0 % , and 7.5 % vs vehicle ( 27 % , 26 % , and 32 % vs 14 % , respectively ; slope P = 0.030 ) . In cohort 3 of study 2 , 7 % of patients achieved treatment success with tavaborole 5.0 % at day 360 . Negative culture rates at day 180 in study 1 were numerically higher for tavaborole 2.5 % , 5.0 % , and 7.5 % vs vehicle ( slope P = 0.046 ) . Application-site reactions of general irritation , erythema , scaling , and stinging/burning were most common with tavaborole 7.5 % , were generally mild to moderate , and resolved with treatment discontinuation and/or a reduction in dosing frequency . No systemic safety concerns were observed . Tavaborole solution demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety in phase 2 clinical studies . Based on these findings , tavaborole topical solution , 5 % was further investigated in larger , more definitive phase 3 studies . Results from these completed phase 3 studies will provide additional evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of tavaborole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis .',\n",
       " ' Evidence about long-term effects of preventive health services for youth with complex needs is lacking . Prime Time , a youth development intervention , aims to reduce pregnancy risk among vulnerable adolescent females seeking clinic services . In a randomized trial , 253 sexually active females aged 13-17 who were at high risk for pregnancy were assigned to the Prime Time intervention or usual clinic services . The 18-month intervention , initiated in 2007-2008 , comprised regular meetings with case managers and participation in youth leadership groups . Trial participants completed surveys at baseline and 30 months . Regression analyses were used to evaluate differences between groups in sexual and psychosocial outcomes at follow-up . At 30 months , the intervention group reported more months of consistent condom use ( adjusted means , 1.8 vs. 1.1 ) and dual contraceptive use ( 0.9 vs. 0.3 ) in the past seven months than did controls . The intervention was most effective in promoting consistent use among participants with relatively high levels of connectedness to family or school . Fifteen percent of intervention participants , but only 6 % of controls , reported having abstained from sex in the past six months ( adjusted odds ratio , 2.9 ) . Moreover , among high school graduates , those in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to have enrolled in college or technical school ( 72 % vs. 37 % ; odds ratio , 4.5 ) . Health services grounded in a youth development framework can lead to reductions in sexual risk among vulnerable youth that are evident one year following conclusion of services .',\n",

       " \" Korean red ginseng ( KRG ) is a processed ginseng from raw ginseng to enhance safety , preservation and efficacy , known having beneficial effects on women 's health due to its estrogen like function . While estrogen supplementation showed some modulation of endocrine disrupting chemicals , bisphenol A ( BPA ) has been focused as a potential endocrine disrupting chemical . In this study , we examined the efficacy and safety outcomes of KRG against BPA , focusing on female quality of life ( QOL ) . Individual variations in susceptibility to KRG were also investigated with the Sasang Typology , the personalized medicine used for hundred years in Korea . We performed a single-blind randomized clinical trial . Study subjects were young women ( N = 22 ) , consumed 2.7 g of KRG or placebo per day for 2 weeks and filled up questionnaires regarding gynecologic complaints at the 4 time spots . We analyzed urinary total BPA and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , an oxidative stress biomarker , with GC/MS and HPLC/UVD respectively , and diagnosed their Sasang Typology with the questionnaire for the Sasang constitution Classification ( QSCC II ) . KRG consumption decreased urinary BPA and MDA levels ( ps < 0.05 ) and alleviated ` menstrual irregularity ' , ` menstrual pain ' , and ` constipation ' ( ps < 0.05 ) . SoEum type ( Lesser Yin person ) among the Sasang types showed significant alleviation in insomnia , flushing , perspiration and appetite by KRG consumption , rather than other Sasang types . During the intervention , no one experienced any aggravated side effects . We suggest KRG is efficient for protection for female QOL and BPA - exposure and - related oxidative stress . However , individual variation in susceptibility to KRG should be further considered for identifying ideal therapy . KCT0000920 .\",\n",
       " ' Conventional total uncinectomy may be unnecessary in localized maxillary sinus lesion . Partial removal of the uncinate process and middle meatal antrostomy would be sufficient to eradicate the pathological condition . Therefore , we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of partial uncinectomy versus total removal of the uncinate process in patients with localized maxillary sinus disease . In total , 25 patients were assigned randomly to partial and total uncinectomy groups . Preoperative computed tomography established that all patients had localized pathology in the maxillary sinus . The lower half of the uncinate process was removed in the partial uncinectomy group , while the total uncinectomy group underwent the conventional surgery . Time required for the uncinectomy , healing period for the uncinectomy site , incidence of lamina papyracea or nasolacrimal duct injury , obstruction or stenosis of the frontal recess , and incidence of synechia formation in the middle meatus were compared between the groups . All patients completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis . Surgical indications included chronic maxillary sinusitis , fungal sinusitis , antrochoanal polyp , and odontogenic sinusitis . Operation durations and healing periods were significantly shorter in the partial uncinectomy group . One patient had a minor injury to the lamina papyracea and two patients showed partial synechia formations in the total uncinectomy group . However , other parameters did not differ significantly between the groups . Partial uncinectomy may be useful in patients with pathological conditions confined to the maxillary sinus . Shorter operation duration , more rapid healing , and lower incidence of complications are advantages over a conventional total uncinectomy .',\n",
       " ' Cumulative evidence from epidemiological , preclinical and clinical studies suggests estrogens may have psychoprotective effects in schizophrenic patients . Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators could have therapeutic benefits in schizophrenia for both sexes without being hazardous to gynecological tissues or having feminizing effects . Few studies have been conducted regarding the effects of raloxifene on postmenopausal women suffering from schizophrenia . We conducted this placebo-controlled trial to compare the add-on effect of raloxifene to risperidone versus risperidone with placebo . This was an 8-week , parallel-group , placebo-controlled trial undertaken at two universities affiliated psychiatric Hospitals in Iran . Forty-six postmenopausal women with the definite diagnosis of schizophrenia were enrolled in the study . Patients received risperidone ( 6 mg/day in 3 divided doses ) combined with either placebo ( N = 23 ) or 120 mg/day of raloxifene ( N = 23 ) for 8 weeks . Patients were assessed by a psychiatrist at baseline and at 2 and 8 weeks after the start of medical therapy . Efficacy was defined as the change from baseline to endpoint in score on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . For PANSS scores , the main effect comparing two types of intervention was not significant [ F ( 1 , 48 ) = 1.77 , p = 0.18 ] . For positive subscale scores , there was marginal significant interaction between intervention type and time [ F ( 2 , 47 ) = 2.93 , p = 0.06 ] and there was substantial main effect for time [ F ( 2 , 47 ) = 24.39 , p = 0.001 ] within both groups showing reduction in positive subscale scores across the three time periods . In addition , the main effect comparing two types of intervention was significant [ F ( 1 , 48 ) = 3.78 , p = 0.02 ] . On the other hand , for negative subscale scores , the main effect comparing two types of intervention was not significant [ F ( 1 , 48 ) = 1.43 , p = 0.23 ] . For general subscale scores , the main effect comparing two types of intervention was not significant [ F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0.03 , p = 0.86 ] .

Prospective study . A total of 61 patients with asymmetric hearing loss and nonpulsatile chronic tinnitus localized to the poorer ear who were refractory to medical treatment were enrolled . Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups : 1-Hz stimulation applied to the temporoparietal junction either ipsilaterally ( n = 30 ) or contralaterally ( n = 31 ) to the symptomatic ear . Changes in the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) scores and self-rating visual analog scores ( VAS ) for loudness , awareness , and annoyance were analyzed before and after treatment for 6 months . Improved patients were defined as those with decreases in their THI scores by > 10 points and 20 % . There were no major complications or worsening of hearing . When analyzing the THI scores and VAS pre-rTMS and 6 months after rTMS , significant decreases were observed in patients overall ( P < .001 ) . For the comparison of long-term outcomes between the ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation groups , there were no differences in the degree of decrease in THI scores or VAS ( P > .05 ) . In addition , there was no significant difference in the rate of patients who improved between the ipsilateral ( 14 of 30 ) and contralateral ( 16 of 31 ) stimulation groups ( P = .800 ) . The ipsilateral group showed a more rapid improvement than the contralateral group . Daily application of 1-Hz rTMS to the temporoparietal area is safe and has long-term beneficial effects .

The patients were allocated consecutively to either of the 2 groups : Group 1 ( crushing , n = 28 ) and Group 2 ( crushing with intrinsic stripping , n = 27 ) . All procedures were performed endoscopically . The presurgical and 1-year postsurgical endoscopic nasal cavity images and computed tomography ( CT ) scans of all patients were recorded . Preoperative and postoperative measurements were compared using paired t test and Student t test . Gender and mean age of the 42 patients ( 55 conchae bullosa ) were as follows : 23 males , mean age 25.6 ( range , 18 to 41 ) years ; 18 females , mean age 24.2 ( range , 18 to 33 ) years . The patients were followed for 12.5 1.3 months . Comparisons of both the grading of endoscopic images and the concha bullosa volumes measured in CT images before and after treatment showed significant postsurgical reductions in both groups ; comparison between groups showed significant postsurgical decreases for Group 2 in both concha bullosa volumes and in endoscopic scoring ( p < 0.05 ) . Crushing with intrinsic stripping is an effective and easy technique ; when compared to crushing alone ; this technique provides a significantly more decrease in middle concha volumes as demonstrated both by the CT and by endoscopic evaluations .',\n",
       " ' The premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) is a series of physical , mental , and behavioral symptoms with various severities , and disturbs social and personal relationships . The syndrome appears during luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and is a common disorder of reproductive age . Different treatments have been introduced for the syndrome due to its unknown complicated causes . Vitamin B1 ( Thiamin ) may reduce symptoms of the syndrome through affecting the performance of coenzymes in the metabolism of carbohydrates and main branch of amino acid that plays an important role in appearance of physical and mental symptoms of the PMS . Vitamin B1 is the first water-soluble discovered vitamin . As it is effective in neural activity and muscle tonus in different body activities , including hematopoiesis , metabolism of carbohydrates , activities of the central nervous system and neuromuscular system , etc. , it can be effective in this dysmenorrhea that is a disorder resulting from uterine muscular contraction . There are no enough studies and research on the effect of vitamin B1 on the symptoms of PMS , therefore , this study was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin B1 on the symptoms of PMS in students residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences in 2013 . In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial , 80 students with PMS residing at dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences were divided randomly into two groups , vitamin B1 and placebo . The severity of the symptoms of PMS in two cycles , before the intervention and during the intervention , was recorded by the students . The data were collected using an information collection form , PMS provisional diagnosis form , daily status record form , Beck Depression Inventory . The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics . There was no significant difference among the studied variables in terms of confounding variables . The comparison of vitamin B1 group before the intervention with that after the intervention showed that vitamin B1 reduced mean mental ( 35.08 % ) and physical ( 21.2 % ) symptoms significantly ( P < 0.0001 ) . Moreover , there was a significant difference between vitamin B1 and placebo groups in terms of mean mental and physical symptoms , as mean symptoms in vitamin B1 group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group ( P < 0.0001 ) . It seems that vitamin B1 is effective in recovery of mental and physical symptoms of PMS . Therefore , this vitamin can be used to reach a major goal of midwifery , that is , reduction of symptom severity of PMS , without any side effects .',\n",

Mean time to healing up to week 12 was 85.62 days for the SGF group ( SE 1.5 ) and 79.66 days for the S-o-C group ( SE 1.77 ) ( p-value = 0.217 ) . There was no statistically relevant difference regarding the incidence of complete healing of the target ulcers by weeks 12 and 24 between the SGF and the S-o-C groups ( p-value > 0.05 ) . SGF is well tolerated and offers a promising perspective as a carrier substrate for the local release of active pharmaceutical agents into the wound site to promote tissue repair .',\n",
       " \" Genistein from foods or supplements is metabolized by the gut microbiota and the human body , thereby releasing many different metabolites into systemic circulation . The order of their appearance in plasma and the possible influence of food format are still unknown . This study compared the nutrikinetic profiles of genistein metabolites . In a randomized cross-over trial , 12 healthy young volunteers were administered a single dose of 30 mg genistein provided as a genistein tablet , a genistein tablet in low fat milk , and soy milk containing genistein glycosides . A high mass resolution LC-LTQ-Orbitrap FTMS platform detected and quantified in human plasma : free genistein , seven of its phase-II metabolites and 15 gut-derived metabolites . Interestingly , a novel metabolite , genistein-4 ' - glucuronide-7-sulfate ( G-4 ` G-7S ) was identified . Nutrikinetic analysis using population-based modeling revealed the order of appearance of five genistein phase II metabolites in plasma : ( 1 ) genistein-4 ' ,7 - diglucuronide , ( 2 ) genistein-7-sulfate , ( 3 ) genistein-4 ' - sulfate-7-glucuronide , ( 4 ) genistein-4 ' - glucuronide , and ( 5 ) genistein-7-glucuronide , independent of the food matrix . The conjugated genistein metabolites appear in a distinct order in human plasma . The specific early appearance of G-4 ' ,7 - diG suggests a multistep formation process for the mono and hetero genistein conjugates , involving one or two deglucuronidation steps .\",\n",
       " ' Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT ) disease type 1A is the most common form of CMT . The main clinical features are distal weakness , sensory loss , and skeletal deformities . Although pain is a frequent complaint , small fiber involvement in CMT1A has not been studied extensively . We assessed pain and small fiber involvement in 49 CMT1A patients using a variety of pain scales , pain questionnaires , and thermal thresholds . Forty-three of 49 patients ( 88 % ) complained of pain . The pain was localized to the feet in 61 % of patients . Only 18 % of patients had neuropathic pain . Cold and warm detection thresholds were elevated in 53 % and 12 % of patients , respectively . Our findings confirm that CMT1A patients have significant pain , which is more likely to be multifactorial in origin and suggests that a proportion of patients have small fiber dysfunction affecting mainly thinly myelinated A fibers .',\n",
       " ' Metformin monotherapy is recommended as initial treatment of type 2 diabetes . The selection of optimal second-line therapy that is often necessary due to the progressive nature of the disease is still a subject of ongoing discussions . The aim of the international EDGE ( Effectiveness of Diabetes control with vildaGliptin and vildagliptin/mEtformin ) study was to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin vs other oral antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on monotherapy in a real-life clinical setting . In this paper , we present the data of patients participating in the EDGE study in the Czech Republic . Patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on monotherapy were enrolled into the study , and randomised into either the vildagliptin arm or control arm with another OAD at the discretion of the treating physician . Patients with the addition of other incretin-based medications were not enrolled into the study . The efficiency was evaluated as a proportion of patients reaching the combined endpoint of decreasing HbA1c > 3 mmol/mol without hypoglycaemia , peripheral oedema or treatment termination due to gastrointestinal side effects during the 12 months of treatment . 654 patients were enrolled into the study in the Czech Republic . The mean age of the patients when enrolled into the study ( vildagliptin group vs control group ) was 59.5 10.6 vs 63.7 8.5 years , mean body mass index was 32.4 5.7 vs 31.7 6.5 kg/m2 , mean HbA1c was 62 12 vs 64 11 mmol/mol . The probability of reaching the combined primary endpoint ( calculated using a binary logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals ) was higher for vildagliptin regardless of baseline HbA1c or type of medication added in the control group . Primary endpoint was reached by 60.6 % of patients in the vildagliptin group vs 51.3 % of patients in the control group , odds ratio 1.46 ( 1.06 , 1.99 ) ; p < 0.019 . The proportion of patients reaching secondary endpoint ( HbA1c < 54 mmol/mol without hypoglycemic event or weight gain 3 % with baseline glycated hemoglobin > 54 mmol/mol was higher for vildagliptin 45.7 % vs 31.4 % in the control arm , odds ratio 1.84 ( 1.26 , 2.68 ) , p < 0.001 . The rate of adverse events was comparable in both groups . In a real-life clinical set-ting , the percentage of patients reaching the combined endpoint of decreasing HbA1c > 3 mmol/mol , without hypoglycaemia , peripheral oedema or treatment termination due to gastrointestinal side effects was higher after the addition of vildagliptin as compared to other antidiabetic agents with comparable rate of side effects .',\n",
       " ' To evaluate the effect of ozonated oil on palatal wounds . Eighteen patients were randomized and allocated to either the ozone group ( n = 8 ) or control ( n = 10 ) group . Free gingival graft surgery was performed , and post-harvested palatal wounds were treated with either 2 mL ozonated oil or control oil daily for 1 week . A planimetrical analysis analyzed the digital image for the wound sizes and shape factor at baseline , at 24 h , and days 5 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 28 , postoperatively . A cytological analysis used the keratinization and superficial cell indices at baseline , 24 h , and days 3 , 7 , 14 , and 21 and the second and third months , postoperatively . Planimetrical results showed a significant ( P 0.05 ) improvement in wound size on days 5 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 28 , postoperatively , in the ozone group compared to the control group . Cytological results showed a significant ( P 0.001 ) improvement in epithelial healing on days 7 , 14 , and 21 , and the second and third months , postoperatively , after the application of ozonated oil compared to control oil .

       " ' The comparative incidences of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis associated with contemporary ultrasound-guided supraclavicular versus infraclavicular blockade have not received extensive study . We tested the hypothesis that the infraclavicular approach results in a lower incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis compared with supraclavicular blockade when a standard local anesthetic volume and concentration are used . With institutional human ethics board approval , we enrolled 64 patients undergoing right-sided upper extremity surgery in a randomized , blinded , parallel-group trial . Patients were assigned to ultrasound-guided supraclavicular or infraclavicular blockade with 30 mL of 0.5 % ropivacaine . The primary end point was complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis at 30 minutes , defined as a greater than 75 % reduction in diaphragmatic excursion measured with the voluntary sniff test using M-mode ultrasonography . Partial paralysis was defined as a 25 % to 75 % reduction . Eleven ( 34 % ) of 32 patients in the supraclavicular group versus 1 ( 3 % ) of 32 in the infraclavicular group had complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis ( P = 0.001 [ 1-tailed ] ; relative risk , 11.0 [ 95 % confidence interval , 1.5-80 .3 ] ) ; 44 % versus 13 % had any ( complete or partial ) paralysis ( P = 0.006 ; relative risk , 3.5 [ 95 % confidence interval , 1.3-9 .5 ] ) . Eight ( 25 % ) of 32 patients in the supraclavicular group versus 5 ( 16 % ) of 32 in the infraclavicular group reported dyspnea ( P = 0.54 ) . Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular blockade with 30 mL of 0.5 % ropivacaine produced complete hemidiaphragmatic paralysis in approximately one-third of patients . The infraclavicular approach greatly reduced this risk but did not eliminate it . These data may aid in the selection of the approach to brachial plexus blockade , particularly in ambulatory patients and/or those with respiratory comorbidities .',\n",
       " ' Leucine is a key amino acid involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis . We assessed the effect of the supplementation of a lower-protein mixed macronutrient beverage with varying doses of leucine or a mixture of branched chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) on myofibrillar protein synthesis ( MPS ) at rest and after exercise . In a parallel group design , 40 men ( 21 1 y ) completed unilateral knee-extensor resistance exercise before the ingestion of 25 g whey protein ( W25 ) ( 3.0 g leucine ) , 6.25 g whey protein ( W6 ) ( 0.75 g leucine ) , 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 3.0 g total leucine ( W6 + Low-Leu ) , 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine to 5.0 g total leucine ( W6 + High-Leu ) , or 6.25 g whey protein supplemented with leucine , isoleucine , and valine to 5.0 g total leucine . A primed continuous infusion of l - [ ring - ( 13 ) C6 ] phenylalanine with serial muscle biopsies was used to measure MPS under baseline fasted and postprandial conditions in both a rested ( response to feeding ) and exercised ( response to combined feeding and resistance exercise ) leg . The area under the blood leucine curve was greatest for the W6 + High-Leu group compared with the W6 and W6 + Low-Leu groups ( P < 0.001 ) . In the postprandial period , rates of MPS were increased above baseline over 0-1 .5 h in all treatments . Over 1.5-4 .5 h , MPS remained increased above baseline after all treatments but was greatest after W25 ( 267 % ) and W6 + High-Leu ( 220 % ) treatments ( P = 0.002 ) . A low-protein ( 6.25 g ) mixed macronutrient beverage can be as effective as a high-protein dose ( 25 g ) at stimulating increased MPS rates when supplemented with a high ( 5.0 g total leucine ) amount of leucine . These results have important implications for formulations of protein beverages designed to enhance muscle anabolism . This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 1530646 .',\n",

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of 12 weeks of prucalopride treatment compared with placebo in men with chronic constipation . This was a multicenter , stratified , randomized , parallel-group , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 3 study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01147926 ) . The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a mean of three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements ( SCBMs ) per week across the treatment period . Efficacy end points were assessed using daily electronic diaries , global assessment of the severity of constipation and efficacy of treatment , and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms ( PAC-SYM ) and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life ( PAC-QOL ) questionnaires . In total , 374 patients were enrolled in the study . Significantly more patients achieved a mean of three or more SCBMs per week in the prucalopride group ( 37.9 % ) than in the placebo group ( 17.7 % , P < 0.0001 ) . The proportion of patients rating their constipation treatment as `` quite a bit '' to `` extremely '' effective at the final on-treatment visit was 46.7 and 30.4 % in the prucalopride and placebo groups , respectively . The difference between treatment groups was statistically significant ( P < 0.0001 ) . The proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 1 point in PAC-QOL satisfaction subscale score was 52.7 and 38.8 % in the prucalopride and placebo groups , respectively ( P = 0.0035 ) . Prucalopride had a good safety profile and was well tolerated . Prucalopride is effective , has a good safety profile , and is well tolerated for the treatment of men with chronic constipation .\",\n",
       " ' People with prediabetes are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus . Weight reduction through lifestyle modification can significantly reduce diabetes risk . Yet , weight loss varies among individuals and some people do not achieve clinically meaningful weight loss after treatment . Our aim was to evaluate the time point and threshold for achieving 5 % weight loss after completion of a 16-week worksite , lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention . Weight change before and after the behavioral intervention among participants randomized to the experimental group was examined . Individuals with prediabetes aged 18 to 65 years with a body mass index ( calculated as kg/m ( 2 ) ) of 25 to 50 at Ohio State University were eligible . The 16-week , group-based intervention , adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program , was delivered to 32 participants in the experimental group . Percent weight loss was assessed weekly during the intervention and at 4 - and 7-month follow-up . Linear regression modeled the relationship between percent weight loss during month 1 of the intervention and percent weight loss at 4 and 7 months . Logistic regression modeled failure to lose 5 % weight loss at 4 and 7 months using weekly weight change during the first month of intervention . Percent weight loss at intervention week 5 was significantly associated with percent weight loss at 4 and 7 months ( all P < 0.001 ) . Only 11.1 % and 12.5 % of participants who failed to achieve a 2.5 % weight-loss threshold during month 1 achieved 5 % weight loss at months 4 and 7 , respectively . The first month of lifestyle treatment is a critical period for helping participants achieve weight loss . Otherwise , individuals who fail to achieve at least 2.5 % weight loss may benefit from more intensive rescue efforts or stepped-care interventions .',\n",
       " ' Mealtime insulin is commonly added to manage hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes when basal insulin is insufficient . However , this complex regimen is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia . This study compared the efficacy and safety of exenatide twice daily or mealtime insulin lispro in patients inadequately controlled by insulin glargine and metformin despite up-titration . In this 30-week , open-label , multicenter , randomized , noninferiority trial with 12 weeks prior insulin optimization , 627 patients with insufficient postoptimization glycated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) were randomized to exenatide ( 10-20 g/day ) or thrice-daily mealtime lispro titrated to premeal glucose of 5.6-6 .0 mmol/L , both added to insulin glargine ( mean 61 units/day at randomization ) and metformin ( mean 2,000 mg/day ) . Randomization HbA1c and fasting glucose ( FG ) were 8.3 % ( 67 mmol/mol ) and 7.1 mmol/L for exenatide and 8.2 % ( 66 mmol/mol ) and 7.1 mmol/L for lispro . At 30 weeks postrandomization , mean HbA1c changes were noninferior for exenatide compared with lispro ( -1.13 and -1.10 % , respectively ) ; treatment differences were -0.04 ( 95 % CI -0.18 , 0.11 ) in per-protocol ( n = 510 ) and -0.03 ( 95 % CI -0.16 , 0.11 ) in intent-to-treat ( n = 627 ) populations . FG was lower with exenatide than lispro ( 6.5 vs. 7.2 mmol/L ; P = 0.002 ) . Weight decreased with exenatide and increased with lispro ( -2.5 vs. +2.1 kg ; P < 0.001 ) . More patients reported treatment satisfaction and better quality of life with exenatide than lispro , although a larger proportion of patients with exenatide experienced treatment-emergent adverse events . Exenatide resulted in fewer nonnocturnal hypoglycemic episodes but more gastrointestinal adverse events than lispro . Adding exenatide to titrated glargine with metformin resulted in similar glycemic control as adding lispro and was well tolerated . These findings support exenatide as a noninsulin addition for patients failing basal insulin .',\n",
       " \" We evaluated the effect of the MD-Logic system on overnight glycemic control at patients ' homes . Twenty-four patients ( aged 12-43 years ; average A1c 7.5 0.8 % , 58.1 8.4 mmol/mol ) were randomly assigned to participate in two overnight crossover periods , each including 6 weeks of consecutive nights : one under closed loop and the second under sensor-augmented pump ( SAP ) therapy at patients ' homes in real-life conditions . The primary end point was time spent with sensor glucose levels below 70 mg/dL ( 3.9 mmol/L ) overnight . Closed-loop nights significantly reduced time spent in hypoglycemia ( P = 0.02 ) and increased the percentage of time spent in the target range of 70-140 mg/dL ( P = 0.003 ) compared with nights when the SAP therapy was used . The time spent in substantial hyperglycemia above 240 mg/dL was reduced by a median of 52.2 % ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 4.8 , 72.9 % ; P = 0.001 ) under closed-loop control compared with SAP therapy . Overnight total insulin doses were lower in the closed-loop nights compared with the SAP nights ( P = 0.04 ) . The average daytime glucose levels after closed-loop operation were reduced by a median of 10.0 mg/dL ( IQR -2.7 , 19.2 ; P = 0.017 ) while lower total insulin doses were used ( P = 0.038 ) . No severe adverse events occurred during closed-loop control ; there was a single event of severe hypoglycemia during a control night . The long-term home use of automated overnight insulin delivery by the MD-Logic system was found to be a feasible , safe , and an effective tool to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia and improve overnight glycemic control in subjects with type 1 diabetes .\",\n",
       " ' This study aimed to describe pretreatment patient characteristics and baseline quality-of-life scores as they relate to the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced/recurrent cervical cancer . The study sample was drawn from Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 179 and 204 . Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were considered in 4 specified categories as follows : peripheral neuropathy , fatigue , hematological , and gastrointestinal ( GI ) . The data variables explored included age , stage , pretreatment radiation , performance status ( PS ) at treatment initiation , and baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix ( FACT-Cx ) score . A logistic regression model was developed with various adverse events as binary ( 0/1 ) outcomes . Six hundred seventy-three patient-reported questionnaires were used in the analyses . At baseline , pain was the most severe patient-reported symptom . Baseline line-item patient concerns did demonstrate specific correlations with the development of individual toxicities . In 401 patients who were enrolled on Gynecologic Oncology Group 204 ( fatigue not measured on 179 ) , a worse PS predicted the development of grade 3 or 4 fatigue ( odds ratio , 2.78 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.66-4 .68 ) . Exposure to previous radiation , treatment regimen , and a worse FACT-Cx score were associated with the reporting of both grade 3 or 4 leukopenia ( P < 0.05 ) and anemia ( P < 0.0005 ) . Performance status and treatment regimen ( P < 0.05 ) were associated with the development of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia . Age and treatment regimen ( P < 0.05 ) were associated with the development of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia . The FACT-Cx score ( P = 0.0016 ) predicted grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity . The development of fatigue , hematological , and GI toxicity might be predictable based on factors other than treatment assignment such as age , PS , and patient-reported quality-of-life measurement .',\n",
       " ' The ongoing scale-up of antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in sub-Saharan Africa has prompted the interest in surveillance of transmitted and acquired HIV drug resistance . Resistance data on virological failure and mutations in HIV infected populations initiating treatment in sub-Saharan Africa is sparse . HIV viral load ( VL ) and resistance mutations pre-ART and after 6 months were determined in a prospective cohort study of ART-nave HIV patients initiating first-line therapy in Jimma , Ethiopia . VL measurements were done at baseline and after 3 and 6 months . Genotypic HIV drug resistance ( HIVDR ) was performed on patients exhibiting virological failure ( > 1000 copies/mL at 6 months ) or slow virological response ( > 5000 copies/mL at 3 months and < 1000 copies/mL at 6 months ) . Two hundred sixty five patients had VL data available at baseline and at 6 months . Virological failure was observed among 14 ( 5.3 % ) participants out of 265 patients . Twelve samples were genotyped and six had HIV drug resistance ( HIVDR ) mutations at baseline . Among virological failures , 9/11 ( 81.8 % ) harbored one or more HIVDR mutations at 6 months . The most frequent mutations were K103N and M184VI . Our data confirm that the currently recommended first-line ART regimen is efficient in the vast majority of individuals initiating therapy in Jimma , Ethiopia eight years after the introduction of ART . However , the documented occurrence of transmitted resistance and accumulation of acquired HIVDR mutations among failing patients justify increased vigilance by improving the availability and systematic use of VL testing to monitor ART response , and underlines the need for rapid , inexpensive tests to identify the most common drug resistance mutations .',\n",
       " ' Mirror therapy ( MT ) and electromyography-triggered neuromuscular stimulation ( ETMS ) are both effective treatments for impaired upper limbs following stroke . A combination of these two treatments ( ETMS-MT ) may result in greater gain than either treatment alone . The feasibility and possible effects of ETMS-MT upon upper extremity function were investigated in stroke patients . Thirteen post-acute stroke patients were randomly assigned to an immediate ETMS-MT group or a delayed ETMS-MT group and then underwent an 8-week training program . The immediate ETMS-MT group received ETMS-MT in addition to physical and occupational therapy ( PT+OT ) for 4 weeks . They then received only PT+OT for the next 4 weeks . In the delayed ETMS-MT group , interventions were provided in the reverse order . The main outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) . The immediate ETMS-MT group showed significantly greater gain in FMA in the first 4 weeks . The delayed ETMS-MT group showed significantly greater gain in active range of motion during the latter 4 weeks . No adverse effects were reported following ETMS-MT . ETMS-MT might be as effective as independent MT or ETMS without causing any side effects . Future research should focus upon the direct comparisons between independent and combined interventions .',\n",
       " ' Gold-standard assessment of acute wound healing has traditionally been through histological analysis of biopsied tissue . However , this process is invasive with recognized side-effects . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) is a noninvasive technique generating high-resolution real-time images of cutaneous architecture . To compare OCT with histological assessment of in vivo acute wound healing and ascertain the level of agreement between modalities for measurement of defined cutaneous structures . Punch biopsies ( 5mm ) were harvested from 50 healthy volunteers . Wounds healed by secondary intention until they were re-excised 7 , 14 , 21 or 28days later depending on random group allocation . Wounds were assessed weekly for 6weeks using OCT and compared with histological findings derived from time-matched biopsies . Dimensions of four cutaneous structures were measured using both modalities and the level of agreement was established by Bland-Altman analysis . The mean greyscale value ( MGV ) of the upper reticular dermis was derived from OCT images at all time points . Both techniques showed anatomical congruity in normal and wounded skin with correlating architectural changes associated with inflammatory , proliferative and remodelling wound healing phases . MGV was significantly increased 6weeks after wounding ( P = 0001 ) and may represent a novel measure of wound fibrosis . Despite good association of histomorphometric values with low but consistent bias ( range -4181 to 0431m ) , Bland-Altman plots demonstrated poor agreement between OCT and histology . Optical coherence tomography enabled accurate assessment of healing tissue comparable with histological analysis of biopsy specimens . This noninvasive tool is highly suited to wound assessment and may represent a diagnostic alternative to punch biopsies .',\n",
       " ' Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is commoner in patients with fluid-retaining states than in those without fluid retention , in men than in women , and worsens with aging . In men , OSA severity is related to the amount of fluid shifting out of the legs overnight , but a cause-effect relationship is not established . Our objective was to test the hypothesis that mimicking fluid overload during sleep would increase severity of OSA more in older ( 40 years ) than in younger men ( < 40 years ) . Randomized , single-blind , double crossover study . Research sleep laboratory . Seven older and 10 younger men with non-severe or no sleep apnea , matched for body mass index . During the control arm , normal saline was infused to keep the vein open . During intervention , subjects received an intravenous bolus of normal saline ( 22 mL/kg body weight ) after sleep onset while they were wearing compression stockings to prevent fluid accumulation in the legs . Compared to younger men , infusion of similar amounts of saline in older men caused a greater increase in neck circumference ( P < 0.05 ) and in the AHI ( 32.2 22.1 vs. 2.2 7.1 , P = 0.002 ) . Older men are more susceptible to the adverse effects of intravenous fluid loading on obstructive sleep apnea severity than younger men . This may be due to age-related differences in the amount of fluid accumulating in the neck or upper airway collapsibility in response to intravenous fluid loading . These possibilities remain to be tested in future studies .',\n",
       " ' Biopsy confirmed that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) may naturally regress or progress . Currently , the risk assessment for CIN progression to cervical cancer is still not satisfactory in clinical practice . We investigated copy number and protein expression of TP63 and MYC and explored the possibility to use them as progression biomarkers . Copy numbers of TP63 and MYC , as well as human papilloma virus ( HPV ) integration status , were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 39 patients with CIN and 66 patients with cervical cancer . Corresponding protein expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry . Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to measure the diagnostic test performance for the detection of cervical cancer from CIN . Sensitivity and specificity values of biomarkers were calculated . The average copy number and expression of TP63 and MYC , as well as the HPV integration rate , increased in the progression of CIN to cervical cancer . Receiver operating characteristic analysis for detection of cervical cancer resulted in area under the curve ( AUC ) values of TP63 copy number ( AUC , 0.96 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.91-1 .00 ) , MYC copy number ( AUC , 0.92 ; 95 % CI , 0.85-0 .96 ) , TP63 expression ( AUC , 0.73 ; 95 % CI , 0.61-0 .85 ) , and HPV-16 integration ( AUC , 0.73 ; 95 % CI , 0.60-0 .85 ) . MYC expression was not able to statistically distinguish cancer from CIN ( P = 0.393 ) . The combinations increased the specificity slightly but not sensitivity . Among them , TP63 amplification showed the best diagnostic performance . Amplification and overexpression of TP63 and MYC , and HPV integration rate , are associated with the transition of CIN to cervical cancer . Future studies on these biomarkers will help to assess the risk of CIN progression .',\n",

PA32540 is a coordinated-delivery , combination tablet consisting of enteric-coated aspirin ( EC-ASA ) 325 mg and immediate-release ( IR ) omeprazole 40 mg . Two identically-designed , 6-month , randomized , double-blind trials evaluated PA32540 vs. EC-ASA 325 mg in a secondary cardiovascular disease prevention population taking aspirin 325 mg daily for 3 months and at risk for ASA-associated gastric ulcers ( GUs ) . The combined study population was 1049 subjects ( 524 randomized to PA32540 , 525 to EC-ASA 325 mg ) . The primary endpoint was the occurrence of endoscopically-determined gastric ulceration over 6 months . Safety outcomes included the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) and UGI symptoms . Significantly fewer PA32540-treated subjects ( 3.2 % ) developed endoscopic GUs vs. EC-ASA 325 mg-treated subjects ( 8.6 % ) ( P < .001 ) . Overall occurrence of MACE was low ( 2.1 % ) , with no significant differences between treatments in types or incidence of MACE . PA32540-treated subjects had significantly fewer UGI symptoms ( P < .001 ) and significantly fewer discontinuations due to pre-specified UGI adverse events ( 1.5 % vs. 8.2 % , respectively ; P < .001 ) . PA32540 reduced the incidence of endoscopic GUs compared to EC-ASA 325 mg , but with a similar cardiovascular event profile . Due to fewer UGI symptoms , continuation on aspirin therapy was greater in the PA32540 treatment arm .',\n",

Many food-allergic-children/carers are unsure when to use their adrenaline autoinjectors , contributing to a low quality of life and worse outcomes in the setting of an acute allergic reaction . The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of 24-hour telephone access to specialist clinical advice on disease-specific quality of life . A pragmatic two-arm , parallel-group randomized control trial was conducted . Children/carers ( < 16years ) with food allergy , trained in adrenaline auto-injector use , were recruited from a hospital-based paediatric allergy clinic . Baseline disease-specific quality of life was ascertained using the validated Food-Allergy-Related Quality-of-Life Questionnaire ( FAQLQ ) , either Parent Form , Child Form or Teenager Form depending on child 's age . Participants were then centrally randomized for a 6-month period to 24-hour telephone specialist support line or to usual care . The primary outcome measure was a change in FAQL scores , at one and 6months postrandomization , compared with baseline . The minimum clinically important difference ( MCID ) in score is 0.5 . Fifty two children/carers were recruited . FAQL scores remained static in the control group across the three time points .

       " ' To evaluate the effects of prone position ventilation combined with recruitment maneuvers ( RM ) on clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . In this prospective , randomized , controlled trial , we randomly assigned 116 sequential patients with severe ARDS to the intervention group ( which undergo prone-positioning with RM sessions of at least 10 hours ) or to the control group ( which be left in the supine position ) . From July 2012 to July 2013 , 116 severe ARDS patients sequentially admitted to the critical department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital were enrolled in the study with 60 patients assigned to the control group and 56 patients to the intervention group . No significant difference was found between the two groups in the demographics including the median patient age , sex ratio , initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores , initial pulmonary function and the sources of ARDS . The oxygenation index recorded in the supine position was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group since day 3 , whereas the positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired O2 were significantly lower in the intervention group . The plateau pressure and static compliance of the respiratory system were similar in the two groups . The intervention group had shorter length of ICU stay , fewer ventilation days and decreased 28-day mortality than the control group . The tracheotomy ratio and the time to successful extubation were similar in the two groups . No significant difference between the two groups was shown in the incidence of complications , except for the grade 1 pressure sore , which was higher in the intervention group . In patients with severe ARDS , application of prolonged prone-positioning with RM sessions significantly improves the clinical outcomes .',\n",
       " ' Diets rich in fermentable residues increase intestinal gas production . Our aim was to demonstrate the potential effects of diet on gas-related symptoms . The effect of a low-flatulogenic test diet ( restricted to foodstuffs low in fermentable residues ; n = 15 ) was compared to that of a balanced control diet ( Mediterranean type ; n = 15 ) in 30 patients complaining of flatulence and other abdominal symptoms using a randomized parallel design . The following outcomes were measured daily : number of anal gas evacuations by an event marker , severity of gas-related symptoms by 0-10 scales , and sensation of digestive comfort by a -5 ( unpleasant ) to +5 ( pleasant ) scale . Measurements were taken pretreatment for 3days on their habitual diet and for 7days during the treatment phase . No pretreatment differences were detected between patients allocated to the control or test diets . The test diet significantly reduced the number of gas evacuations ( by 5410 % ; p = 0.002 vs basal diet ) whereas the control diet had a lesser effect ( reduction by 289 % ; p = 0.059 vs basal diet ; p = 0.089 vs test diet ) . Compared to the control diet , the test diet significantly reduced flatulence ( by 487 % vs 278 % , respectively ; p = 0.018 ) , abdominal distension ( by 484 % vs 2212 % , respectively ; p = 0.038 ) , and enhanced digestive well-being ( by 14918 % vs 5822 % , respectively ; p = 0.006 ) . In patients with gas-related symptoms , a low-flatulogenic diet produces immediate beneficial effects with digestive , cognitive , and emotive dimensions . The number of gas evacuations is an objective biological marker of response to dietary treatment .',\n",

Multicenter , single-blind , parallel-group , cluster randomized , controlled trial comparing TIA/stroke electronic decision support guided management with usual care . Main outcomes were guideline adherence and 90-day stroke risk . Secondary outcomes were cerebrovascular/vascular/death / adverse events , cost , and user feedback . Main analysis was logistic regression with a normal random effect for clusters using a generalized linear mixed model . Twenty-nine clinics were randomized to intervention , 27 to control , recruiting 172 and 119 eligible patients . More intervention patients received guideline-adherent care ( 131/172 ; 76.2 % ) than control patients ( 49/119 ; 41.2 % ) ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 4.57 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.39-8 .71 ; p < 0.001 ) .

Primary care use of the TIA/stroke electronic decision support tool improves guideline adherence , safely reduces treatment cost , achieves positive user feedback , and may reduce cerebrovascular and vascular event risk following TIA/stroke . This study provides Class II evidence that a primary care electronic decision support tool improves guideline adherence and might reduce 90-day stroke risk .',\n",
       " ' Nicotine is a known analgesic . Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that intranasal nicotine administered intraoperatively reduces the need for postoperative opioids . The secondary outcomes included evaluation of both postoperative pain and nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) . Nonsmoking female patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric operations were randomized to receive either 3 mg intranasal nicotine ( N = 42 ) or placebo spray ( N = 47 ) at the conclusion of surgery . Postoperative opioid use converted to intravenous morphine equivalents ( iv MEQ ) and PONV rates were recorded during both the recovery room postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) stay and the first 24 postoperative hours . All patients received multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis . Total iv MEQ were not significantly reduced during the PACU stay in patients receiving nicotine ( median [ interquartile range ( IQR ) ] , 5.3 [ 0 , 10.0 ] mg for nicotine vs. 5.2 [ 0 , 12.7 ] mg for placebo , one-tailed P = 0.414 ) or for the first 24 h following PACU discharge ( 39.6 [ 20.0 , 52.5 ] mg for nicotine vs. 32.7 [ 20.3 , 51.3 ] mg for placebo , one-tailed P = 0.752 ) . For the combined period ( PACU + 24-h post-PACU discharge ) , iv MEQ were 45.8 [ 27.0 , 58.6 ] mg for nicotine and 39.4 [ 23.5 , 60.0 ] mg for placebo , one-tailed P = 0.801 . Compared to placebo , a higher percentage of patients administered nicotine received antiemetics in the PACU ( 57.1 vs. 25.5 % , P = 0.002 ) . Intraoperative intranasal nicotine did not exhibit opioid-sparing effect in nonsmoking bariatric female patients .

All patients took Caltrate D Tablet ( containing Ca 600 mg and Vit D3 125 IU ) , one tablet daily . Patients in the treatment group took SJR , 6 g each time , twice daily for 6 successive months . The bone mineral density ( BMD ) level was detected before treatment and at months 6 after treatment . Levels of bone alkaline phosphatase ( BALP ) , bone gla protein ( BGP ) , tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) , and C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen ( CTX-II ) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . The drug safety was also assessed . Compared with before treatment , BMD of L2-4 and femur neck obviously increased in the treatment group at month 6 after treatment ( P < 0.01 ) , serum BALP and TRAP decreased ( P < 0.05 ) . Compared with before treatment , BMD of L2-4 and femur neck obviously decreased in the control group at month 6 after treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , serum BALP and TRAP increased ( P < 0.01 ) . Compared with the control group , lumbar and femur neck BMD obviously increased , serum levels of BGP and BALP obviously decreased , and serum levels of CTX-II and TRAP obviously increased in the treatment group at month 6 after treatment ( P < 0.01 ) . No serious adverse event occurred during the treatment period . Bone fracture occurred in one case of the control group ( 5.8 % ) . SJR could attenuate bone loss of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received AIs , increase BMD and improve abnormal bone metabolism .',\n",
       " ' School-based influenza immunization can effectively address accessibility barriers , but injected inactivated influenza vaccines ( IIV ) may not be acceptable to some children and parents in school settings . To better understand the feasibility of offering intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccines ( LAIV ) through schools , we assessed uptake , stakeholder acceptability , and cost of school-based delivery of LAIV compared to IIV . We piloted an open-label cluster randomized trial involving 10 elementary schools in Peterborough , Ontario during the 2013-2014 influenza vaccination campaign . Schools were randomized to having students receive IIV or LAIV at publicly-funded school-based clinics organized by the local public health department . We measured the percentage of students vaccinated with at least one dose of influenza vaccine at school . Stakeholder acceptability was evaluated through a questionnaire of parents and interviews of public health department personnel and school principals . We compared the costs per dose of vaccine administered , including staff time and costs of vaccines and supplies . Single-dose influenza vaccine uptake was higher for the five schools offering LAIV than for the five offering IIV ( 19.3 % vs. 12.2 % , p = 0.02 ) . Interviews with nine school principals and five public health department personnel suggested that the clinics ran smoothly with little disruption to school routines , and that LAIV was associated with increased efficiency and calmer children . All interviewees cited unfamiliarity with LAIV and the study recruitment package length as potential reasons for low uptake . The cost per vaccine dose administered was $ 38.67 for IIV and $ 43.50 for LAIV . Use of LAIV in school-based clinics was associated with increased vaccine uptake and the perception among immunizing staff of reduced child anxiety , but also slightly higher vaccine administration costs , compared to IIV . However , uptake was low for both groups . More effective strategies to promote influenza vaccines and to obtain parent consent may improve vaccine uptake . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01995851 .

       " ' Although children vaccinated with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) had fewer episodes of acute otitis media ( AOM ) , this trial was unable to prove a simultaneous decrease in nasopharyngeal carriage . Carriage rates of AOM pathogens in the nasopharynx are high among children , and colonization is the first step towards infection . The possible impact of PCV on carriage is therefore of interest , particularly in children with recurrent AOM . The aims of this study were to examine the effect of heptavalent PCV on carriage of AOM pathogens in children at high risk of developing recurrent disease , and to monitor carriage of resistant pathogens in vaccinated and unvaccinated children . A total of 109 children with an onset of AOM before 6 months of age , 89 of whom developed recurrent disease , were enrolled in a trial . Fifty-two children were vaccinated and all were closely monitored for 3 years . There was no difference statistically between vaccinated children and controls concerning the carriage of any of the major AOM pathogens . There was evidence of within-child clustering for S. pneumoniae ( p = 0.002 ) and H. influenzae ( p < 0.001 ) , indicating that children continued to carry either species over time . Resistance rates were generally low and comparable with national levels .',\n",
       " ' Locoregional anesthesia is an effective method for evaluating cerebral function during carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) . Landmark-guided regional anesthesia ( RA ) is currently used for CEA and can provoke substantial perioperative hypertension . Ultrasound-guided RA ( US-RA ) is a new method for performing RA in CEA ; however , the effect on sympathetic activity and blood pressure is uncertain . This study assessed early sympathetic activity during CEA in US-RA compared with general anesthesia ( GA ) . Patients were prospectively randomized to receive US-RA ( n = 32 ) or GA ( n = 28 ) for CEA . The primary end point was the change in systolic arterial blood pressure after induction of anesthesia ( just before starting surgery ) comparing US-RA with GA. . We also recorded heart rate and analyzed concentrations of plasma blood hormones , including cortisol , metanephrine , and normetanephrine at five different times . Creatinine kinase , troponin I , and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were analyzed to detect potential changes in cardiac biomarkers during the procedure . Systolic arterial blood pressure ( mean standard deviation ) increased significantly in US-RA patients compared with GA patients even before surgery was initiated ( 180 26 mm Hg vs 109 24 mm Hg ; P < .001 ) , then remained elevated during the entire surgery and returned to baseline values 1 hour after admission to the postoperative anesthesia care unit . Heart rate ( US-RA : 78 16 beats/min , GA : 52 12 beats/min ; P < .001 ) and cortisol levels ( US-RA : 155 97 g/L , GA : 99 43 g/L ; P = .006 ) were also significantly higher in the US-RA group after induction of anesthesia . Other values did not differ . The US-RA technique for CEA induces temporary intraoperative hypertension and an increase in stress hormone levels . Nevertheless , US-RA is a feasible , effective , and safe form of locoregional for CEA that enables targeted placement of low volumes of local anesthesia under direct visualization .',\n",

Vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for a range of diseases . However , the optimal strategies to achieve and maintain vitamin D adequacy ( sun exposure , vitamin D supplementation or both ) , and whether sun exposure itself has benefits over and above initiating synthesis of vitamin D , remain unclear . The Sun Exposure and Vitamin D Supplementation ( SEDS ) Study aims to compare the effectiveness of sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation for the management of vitamin D insufficiency , and to test whether these management strategies differentially affect markers of immune and cardio-metabolic function . The SEDS Study is a multi-centre , randomised controlled trial of two different daily doses of vitamin D supplementation , and placebo , in conjunction with guidance on two different patterns of sun exposure . Participants recruited from across Australia are aged 18-64 years and have a recent vitamin D test result showing a serum 25 ( OH ) D level of 40-60 nmol/L .

       " \" Patching of the operative eye is occasionally used in pediatric strabismus surgery . The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological and physiologic effects of patching after operation by multifactorial methods . We analyzed the perioperative behaviors of 61 children with strabismus conducted from June 2012 to July 2013 in this prospective longitudinal study . The children were randomized into 2 groups . Patients in the patching group underwent postoperative patching and others received no patching . Main outcome measures included The Faces Pain Scale-Revised score or numerical rating scales score , Children 's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) score , crying time , and preoperative and postoperative physiologic parameters . Crying time was significantly longer in the patching group than in the no patching group , but self-report scores showed no difference in the groups . Repeated-measures analysis of variance on ranks revealed that postoperative CHEOPS score was lower in the no patching group than in the patching group , whereas no physiologic parameters were significantly different in the 2 groups . Patching is not necessary for reducing postoperative pain or the risk of infection in children undergoing strabismus surgery .\",\n",
       " ' To assess the effect of a physical activity ( PA ) intervention on brain and behavioral indices of executive control in preadolescent children . Two hundred twenty-one children ( 7-9 years ) were randomly assigned to a 9-month afterschool PA program or a wait-list control . In addition to changes in fitness ( maximal oxygen consumption ) , electrical activity in the brain ( P3-ERP ) and behavioral measures ( accuracy , reaction time ) of executive control were collected by using tasks that modulated attentional inhibition and cognitive flexibility . Fitness improved more among intervention participants from pretest to posttest compared with the wait-list control ( 1.3 mL/kg per minute , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.3 to 2.4 ; d = 0.34 for group difference in pre-to-post change score ) . Intervention participants exhibited greater improvements from pretest to posttest in inhibition ( 3.2 % , 95 % CI : 0.0 to 6.5 ; d = 0.27 ) and cognitive flexibility ( 4.8 % , 95 % CI : 1.1 to 8.4 ; d = 0.35 for group difference in pre-to-post change score ) compared with control . Only the intervention group increased attentional resources from pretest to posttest during tasks requiring increased inhibition ( 1.4 V , 95 % CI : 0.3 to 2.6 ; d = 0.34 ) and cognitive flexibility ( 1.5 V , 95 % CI : 0.6 to 2.5 ; d = 0.43 ) . Finally , improvements in brain function on the inhibition task ( r = 0.22 ) and performance on the flexibility task correlated with intervention attendance ( r = 0.24 ) . The intervention enhanced cognitive performance and brain function during tasks requiring greater executive control . These findings demonstrate a causal effect of a PA program on executive control , and provide support for PA for improving childhood cognition and brain health .',\n",

Cilengitide selectively inhibits v3 and v5 integrins and is investigated as a treatment strategy . The phase I/II study ADVANTAGE evaluated cilengitide combined with cisplatin , 5-fluorouracil , and cetuximab ( PFE ) in R/M-SCCHN . The phase II part reported here was an open-label , randomized , controlled trial investigating progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Patients received up to six cycles of PFE alone or combined with cilengitide 2000 mg once ( CIL1W ) or twice ( CIL2W ) weekly . Thereafter , patients received maintenance therapy ( cilengitide arms : cilengitide plus cetuximab ; PFE-alone arm : cetuximab only ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . One hundred and eighty-two patients were treated . Median PFS per investigator read was similar for CIL1W + PFE , CIL2W + PFE , and PFE alone ( 6.4 , 5.6 , and 5.7 months , respectively ) . Accordingly , median overall survival and objective response rates were not improved with cilengitide ( 12.4 months/47 % , 10.6 months/27 % , and 11.6 months/36 % , respectively ) . No clinically meaningful safety differences were observed between groups . None of the tested biomarkers ( expression of integrins , CD31 , Ki-67 , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 , vascular endothelial-cadherin , type IV collagen , epidermal growth factor receptor , or p16 for human papillomavirus ) were predictive of outcome . Neither of the cilengitide-containing regimens demonstrated a PFS benefit over PFE alone in R/M-SCCHN patients .',\n",

Subjects were recruited from diabetes and primary care practices at 14 centers throughout the United States and Canada . This is a secondary data analysis of the physical activity data ( type and hours/week ) collected . No intervention was conducted . In all subjects , physical inactivity rose from 24 % at baseline to 33 % at 5 years ( S = 28.93 ; P < .0001 ) .

The effect of daily administration of prasterone ( 0 , 3.25 mg , 6.5 mg or 13mg ) for 12 weeks on FSD in 215 postmenopausal women with or without MSD at baseline was evaluated in a prospective , randomized , double-blind , and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial . Differences were examined on desire , arousal and orgasm . Comparable benefits were observed in women not having MSD ( n = 56 ) vs. those having MSD ( n = 159 ) . The benefits over placebo in prasterone-treated women for desire , avoiding intimacy and vaginal dryness as well as for the total sexual domain of the MENQOL ( Menopause Specific Quality of Life ) questionnaire , ranged between 18.0 % and 38.2 % with P values of < 0.05 or < 0.01 except in one out of 12 subgroups . For the arousal/sensation , arousal/lubrication and summary score of the ASF ( Abbreviated Sexual Function ) questionnaire , in the MSD + group , improvements of 64.2 % ( P = 0.01 ) , 118 % ( P = 0.001 ) and 31.1 % ( P = 0.03 ) were observed over placebo , respectively , while similar differences ( 58.0 % , 67.6 % and 32.1 % ) did not reach statistical significance in the MSD - group having up to only 44 prasterone-treated women compared with 119 in the MSD + group . No MSD at baseline does not apparently affect the effects of intravaginal prasterone on sexual dysfunction . Knowing the absence of significant effects of estrogens on FSD , the present data suggest that vulvovaginal atrophy ( VVA ) and vulvovaginal sexual dysfunction ( VVSD ) are two different consequences of sex steroid deficiency at menopause which can respond independently . In addition , the present data seriously question the justification of pain being part of FSD as well as the separation of FSD into separate domains .',\n",

There is little evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for functional neck/shoulder stiffness . Research using two different placebos may allow an efficient method to tease apart the components of real acupuncture from various kinds of ` non-specific ' effects such as ritual with touch or ritual alone . Herein , we describe a protocol of an ongoing , single-centre , randomised , placebo-controlled trial which aims to assess whether , in functional neck/shoulder stiffness , acupuncture treatment with skin piercing has a specific effect over two types of placebo : skin-touching plus ritual or ritual alone . Six acupuncturists and 400 patients with functional neck/shoulder stiffness are randomly assigned to four treatment groups : genuine acupuncture penetrating the skin , skin-touch placebo or no-touch placebo needles in a double-blind manner ( practitioner-patient blinding ) or no-treatment control group . Each acupuncturist applies a needle to each of four acupoints ( Bladder10 , Small Intestine14 , Gallbladder21 and Bladder42 ) in the neck/shoulder to 50 patients . Before , immediately after and 24 hours after the treatment , patients are asked about the intensity of their neck/shoulder stiffness . After the treatment , practitioners and patients are asked to guess whether the treatment is `` penetrating '' , `` skin-touch '' or `` no-touch '' or to record `` can not identify the treatment '' . In addition to intention-to-treat analysis , we will conduct subgroup analysis based on practitioners ' or patients ' guesses to discuss the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments with skin piercing and various placebo controls . The results of practitioner and patient blinding will be discussed . We believe this study will further distinguish the role of different components of acupuncture .

Eighteen male with CAD ( 62 7 years , 175 2 cm , 84 16 kg , fraction of ejection = 0.49 0.16 ) performed 4 weeks of CT ( n = 9 ) or AT ( n = 9 ) . pVO2 peak , maximal and first ventilatory threshold values of oxygen uptake ( VO2 peak , VO2-vt ) and heart rate ( HRmax , HR-vt ) were measured before and after training session . Total training impulse ( exercise rehabilitation and other paramedical actions ) were evaluated and harmonized between AT and CT according to Foster et al. formula ( 1996 ) RESULTS : No significant difference were found in training impulse between AT and CT ( 3650 220 vs 3497 190 U , P = NS ) . VO2 pic increased after AT ( 16.9 4.4 vs 18.9 4.9 mL O2/min/kg , P < 0.05 ) and remained unchanged after CT ( 17.7 7.8 vs 17.8 7.2 , P = NS ) . Four weeks of training induced significant increase in pVO2 peak , VO2-vt and FC-vt , expressed in absolute or relative value ( P < 0,05 ) , without any difference between AT and CT modalities ( P = NS ) . Improving pVO2 pic following an exercise training does not necessarily preclude an improvement in coronary VO2 pic . pVO2 peak was not improved with the same cardiorespiratory adaptations between AT and CT. . Thus , there seems important to measure gas exchanges of subject with CAD during the incremental test and identify the respective part of muscular and cardiorespiratory functions in exercise exhaustion .',\n",

The vignettes outlined a set of symptoms , the risk that these symptoms might indicate cancer ( 1 % , 2 % , 5 % , or 10 % ) , the relevant testing process , probable treatment , possible alternative diagnoses , and prognosis if cancer were identified . Participants were asked whether they would opt for diagnostic testing on the basis of the information in the vignette . 3469 participants completed 6930 vignettes . 3052 individuals ( 88 % ) opted for investigation in their first vignette . We recorded no strong evidence that participants were more likely to opt for investigation with a 1 % increase in risk of cancer ( odds ratio [ OR ] 102 , 95 % CI 099-106 ; p = 0189 ) , although the association between risk and opting for investigation was strong when colorectal cancer was analysed alone ( 108 , 103-113 ; p = 00001 ) . In multivariable analysis , age had an effect in all three cancer models : participants aged 60-69 years were significantly more likely to opt for investigation than were those aged 40-59 years , and those aged 70 years or older were less likely . Other variables associated with increased likelihood of opting for investigation were shorter travel times to testing centre ( colorectal and lung cancers ) , a family history of cancer ( colorectal and lung cancers ) , and higher household income ( colorectal and pancreatic cancers ) . Participants in our sample expressed a clear preference for diagnostic testing at all risk levels , and individuals want to be tested at risk levels well below those stipulated by UK guidelines . This willingness should be considered during design of cancer pathways , particularly in primary care . The public engagement with our study should encourage general practitioners to involve patients in referral decision making .

       " ' Little is known about the benefit of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) - positive patients with high viral load and normal levels of alanine aminotransferase . We evaluated the effects of single and combination therapies in immune-tolerant patients with chronic hepatitis B. In a double-blind study , nucleos ( t ) ide-nave patients with high levels of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA who were positive for HBeAg and had normal levels of alanine aminotransferase were randomly assigned to groups given either oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF , 300 mg ) and placebo ( n = 64 ) or a combination of TDF ( 300 mg ) and emtricitabine ( 200 mg , n = 62 ) for 192 weeks . The primary end point was proportion of patients with serum levels of HBV DNA < 69 IU/mL at week 192 . The study population ( mean age was 33 years ; 89 % were Asian ) was predominantly infected with HBV genotypes B and C ( 93 % ) , 99 % were HBeAg positive with a mean baseline level of HBV DNA of 8.41 log10 IU/mL . At week 192 , 55 % of patients ( 35 of 64 ) in the TDF + placebo group and 76 % of patients ( 47 of 62 ) in the TDF + emtricitabine group had levels of HBV DNA < 69 IU/mL ( P = .016 ) . No patients were found to have viral resistance to therapy . HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 3 patients ( 5 % ) , all in the TDF + placebo group ; no patient had loss of hepatitis B surface antigen . In multivariate analysis , female sex ( odds ratio = 7.05 ; P = .002 ) and TDF + emtricitabine treatment ( odds ratio = 3.9 ; P = .01 ) were associated with a favorable response . Both regimens were well tolerated . In HBeAg-positive patients with chronic HBV infection , high viral loads , normal levels of alanine aminotransferase , and therapy with the combination of TDF and emtricitabine provided better viral suppression than TDF alone , although rates of HBeAg seroconversion and hepatitis B surface antigen loss were low .',\n",
       " \" Routine immunization is a key child survival intervention . Issues related to quality of service delivery pose operational challenges in delivering effective immunization services . Accumulated evidences suggest that `` supportive supervision '' improves the quality of health care services . During 2009-10 , Govt . of Odisha ( GoO ) and UNICEF jointly piloted this strategy in four districts to improve routine immunization . The present study aims to assess the effect of supportive supervision strategy on improvement of knowledge and practices on routine immunization among service providers . We adopted a ` post-test only ' study design to compare the knowledge and practices of frontline health workers and their supervisors in four intervention districts with that of two control districts . Altogether we interviewed 170 supervisors and supervisees ( health workers ) , each , using semi-structured interview schedules . We also directly observed 25 ice lined refrigerator ( ILR ) points in both groups of districts . The findings were compared with the baseline information , available only for the intervention districts . The health workers in the intervention districts displayed a higher knowledge score in selected items than in the control group . No significant difference in knowledge was observed between control and intervention supervisors . The management practices at ILR points on key routine immunization components were found to have improved significantly in intervention districts . The observed improvements in the ILR management practices indicate positive influence of supportive supervision . Higher level of domain knowledge among intervention health workers on specific items related to routine immunization could be due to successful transfer of knowledge from supervisors . A ` pre-post ' study design should be undertaken to gain insights into the effectiveness of supportive supervision in improving routine immunization services .\",\n",
       " ' Previous global studies examined etanercept ( ETN ) + methotrexate ( MTX ) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , but included few subjects from Latin America . The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of ETN + MTX versus a standard-of-care disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) + MTX in Latin American subjects with moderate to severe active RA despite MTX therapy . This open-label , active-comparator study ( NCT00848354 ) randomized subjects 2:1 to ETN 50 mg/wk + MTX or investigator-selected DMARD ( sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine ) + MTX ( ETN + MTX , n = 281 ; DMARD + MTX , n = 142 ) . The primary end point was the proportion achieving American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) 50 at week 24 . Secondary end points included ACR20/70 , disease activity score ( DAS ) 28 measures , and mean change in modified total Sharp score . Patient-reported outcomes were the Health Assessment Questionnaire , 36-item Short-Form , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , Work Productivity and Activity Impairment : RA ( WPAI : RA ) , and Caregiver Burden and Resource Utilization . Statistical analyses were stratified by country ; test and analysis of covariance were used . Adverse events were monitored . More subjects achieved ACR50 at week 24 with ETN + MTX versus DMARD + MTX ( 62 % vs 23 % , respectively ) , in addition to secondary end points ( P < 0.0001 for all ) ; mean change in modified total Sharp score was lower for the ETN + MTX group ( 0.4 vs 1.4 , respectively ; P = 0.0270 ) . Improvements in patient-reported outcomes favored ETN + MTX for Health Assessment Questionnaire , 36-item Short-Form , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for depression , WPAI : RA , and Caregiver Burden and Resource Utilization emergency department visits for RA ( P < 0.01 ) . Overall , adverse events were similar between the groups ( 69 % vs 68 % , ) ; serious adverse events were also similar ( 4 % vs 1 % ) . The rate of overall infections was higher with ETN + MTX ( 38 % ) than DMARD + MTX ( 22 % , P 0.001 ) . Consistent with published global data among RA patients with inadequate response to MTX , adding ETN to MTX demonstrated better efficacy than adding one other conventional DMARD to MTX . No new safety issues were observed . ETN + MTX provided favorable benefit-risk profile among RA patients from LA region .',\n",
       " ' Despite national guidelines recommending bone mineral density screening with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) in women aged 65 years and older , many women do not receive initial screening . To determine the effectiveness of health system and patient-level interventions designed to increase appropriate DXA testing and osteoporosis treatment through ( 1 ) an invitation to self-refer for DXA ( self-referral ) ; ( 2 ) self-referral plus patient educational materials ; and ( 3 ) usual care ( UC , physician referral ) . Parallel , group-randomized , controlled trials performed at Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) and Kaiser Permanente Georgia ( KPG ) . Women aged 65 years and older without a DXA in past 5 years . DXA completion rates 90 days after intervention mailing and osteoporosis medication receipt 180 days after initial intervention mailing . From > 12,000 eligible women , those randomized to self-referral were significantly more likely to receive a DXA than UC ( 13.0 % -24.1 % self-referral vs. 4.9 % -5.9 % UC , P < 0.05 ) . DXA rates did not significantly increase with patient educational materials . Osteoporosis was detected in a greater proportion of self-referral women compared with UC ( P < 0.001 ) . The number needed to receive an invitation to result in a DXA in KPNW and KPG regions was approximately 5 and 12 , respectively . New osteoporosis prescription rates were low ( 0.8 % -3.4 % ) but significantly greater among self-referral versus UC in KPNW . DXA rates significantly improved with a mailed invitation to schedule a scan without physician referral . Providing women the opportunity to self-refer may be an effective , low-cost strategy to increase access for recommended osteoporosis screening .',\n",
       " ' Budesonide formoterol ( BF ) Spiromax is a breath-actuated dry-powder inhaler designed to deliver similar combinations of budesonide and formoterol as Symbicort Turbohaler . We performed two studies to demonstrate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) equivalence of BF Spiromax with BF Turbohaler . Two single-center , open-label , randomized , 5-period crossover studies were performed . The first study compared BF Spiromax 160/4 .5 g with BF Turbohaler 200/6 g , while the second study compared BF Spiromax 320/9 g with BF Turbohaler 400/12 g. All treatments were administered with and without charcoal . PK parameters were calculated by measuring plasma drug concentrations from blood samples taken pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose . In each study , 90 healthy volunteers were randomized . Bioequivalence of BF Spiromax with BF Turbohaler was demonstrated for budesonide and formoterol ( AUC0-t and Cmax ( 90 % confidence intervals of the geometric mean between-device ratios for both parameters were within the predefined range of 0.80-1 .25 in both studies ) ) . Equivalence was observed without use of charcoal ( overall absorption post-inhalation ) and with charcoal ( pulmonary absorption ) . There were no major differences between treatments in tmax for either budesonide or formoterol . All study treatments were well tolerated ( one treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) in the medium-dose study and four TEAEs in the high-dose study ) . These studies indicate that BF Spiromax ( charcoal block ) is bioequivalent to BF Turbohaler with respect to the PK parameters assessed . Single doses of BF Spiromax were well tolerated ; the overall safety profile of BF Spiromax and BF Turbohaler was similar .',\n",

       " ' CAM2028 , a vehicle that forms a bioadhesive lipid barrier when applied to the oral mucosa , was developed as a carrier system for local delivery of benzydamine , an NSAID used for pain relief in oral mucositis . This trial compared the analgesic effect of CAM2028 plus benzydamine ( CAM2028-benzydamine ) with unmedicated CAM2028 ( CAM2028-control ) for the treatment of oral mucositis in patients with head-and-neck cancer . Thirty-eight study participants were enrolled during their 3rd to 4th week of radiation therapy . Participants were required to have symptomatic oral mucositis ( WHO Grade 2 or above ) at screening and pain scores of at least 6 on an 11-point Likert scale at screening and on each day before treatment with study medication . After undergoing radiation , patients were administered a single dose of CAM2028-control or CAM2028-benzydamine 2 days apart , in a randomized crossover fashion . Pain was assessed over the following 8 h. With both treatments , patients experienced a mean 40 % decrease in pain intensity at 6 h ( the primary study endpoint ) . Both treatments resulted in significant pain relief within 5 min of application that was evident during the entire 8-h assessment period . There was no difference in pain relief between the two interventions at any time point . Both treatments were safe and well tolerated . CAM2028-benzydamine and CAM2028-control were both efficacious in reducing pain in patients with oral mucositis related to radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer . Analgesic effects of both medications were immediate , clinically significant , and persistent for up to 8 h.',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study was to characterize trastuzumab population pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer and the relationship of trastuzumab PK with patient response . A nonlinear mixed effects PK model was built using data from the ToGA study . Patients were randomized to intravenous trastuzumab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone . The influence of demographic , laboratory , and disease characteristics on PK parameters was assessed . An exploratory exposure-response analysis compared various PK parameters at steady state with best overall tumor response and overall survival ( OS ) . Trastuzumab PK was best described by a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear ( Michaelis-Menten ) elimination from the central compartment . Total clearance ( and half-life ) of trastuzumab was concentration-dependent . Body weight , prior gastrectomy , and serum albumin had the greatest influence on trastuzumab PK ; increasing weight and decreasing albumin levels were associated with increased clearance , while prior gastrectomy correlated with decreased clearance . Median values for AUC , Cmax , and Cmin were lower in patients with progressive disease ( PD ) than other response categories , although the 1.5 interquartile ranges overlapped . Patients with the lowest Cmin had the highest PD rate and a shorter OS . In the advanced gastric cancer population , trastuzumab PK was best described by a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination . Predicted PK exposure was lower than previously reported for breast cancer . Patients with the lowest Cmin had a shorter OS and the highest PD rate , but a distinct correlation was not observed for tumor response .',\n",
       " \" Whilst surgery will face an imminent workforce shortage , an increasing majority of students decide against a surgical career . This study evaluated the current career expectations of medical students and tested a hands-on virtual reality ( VR ) intervention as a tool to increase their interest in surgery . Randomly selected medical students of the University of Basel received a short questionnaire to rank their interest in five different postgraduate working environments prior to a lecture . After the lecture they participated in a hands-on VR demonstration . Thereafter an online questionnaire regarding workplace expectations , surgery and VR was sent to the students . The online questionnaire response rate was 87 % ( 225/258 ) . Before using the VR intervention , a nonsurgical career was preferred by the majority of students , followed by a surgical career , cross-disciplinary specialties , research and , finally , nonclinical work . Surgery ( n = 99 , 44 % ) and emergency medicine ( n = 111 , 49 % ) were rated as incompatible with a good work-life balance . Further drawbacks to surgery were apprehension of competitive mentality , unclear career perspectives and longer working hours . The VR intervention had limited impact on re-ranking the five working sectors and slightly increased the students ' interest in surgery . Students ' work environment expectations , their declining interest in a surgical career and the increasing need for surgeons represent challenges for surgical societies to address , in order to improve the attractiveness of surgery amongst students . VR sessions may be integrated as part of the actions required to improve students ' interest in a surgical career and should be further evaluated within controlled study designs .\",\n",

We investigated the influence of 6 % hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) 130/0 .4 on coagulation and inflammation compared with albumin when used for both cardiopulmonary bypass priming and perioperative fluid therapy in patients undergoing complex valvular heart surgery . Fifty four patients were randomly allocated into albumin-HES , albumin-nonHES , and HES-HES groups . The cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was primed with 5 % albumin in the albumin-HES and albumin-nonHES group , and with HES in the HES-HES group . As perioperative fluid , only plasmalyte was used in the albumin-nonHES group whereas HES was used up to 20 mL/kg in the albumin-HES and albumin-HES group . Serial assessments of coagulation profiles using the rotational thromboelastometry and inflammatory markers ( tissue necrosis factor - , interleukin-6 , and interleukin-8 ) were performed . Patients ' characteristics and the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass ( albumin-HES ; 13734 min , HES-HES ; 13647 min , albumin-nonHES ; 13239 min ) were all similar among the groups . Postoperative coagulation profiles demonstrated sporadic increases in clot formation time and coagulation time , without any differences in the actual amount of perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirements among the groups . Also , inflammatory markers showed significant activation after cardiopulmonary bypass without any differences among the groups . Even in the presence of prolonged duration of cardiopulmonary bypass , HES seemed to yield similar influence on the ensuing coagulopathy and inflammatory response when used for priming and perioperative fluid therapy following complex valvular heart surgery compared with conventional fluid regimen including albumin and plasmalyte .\",\n",

Forty-five healthy adults at two different sites ( n = 45 ) performed saccade tasks with varying levels of target predictability : predictable ( PRED ) , position predictable ( pPRED ) , time predictable ( tPRED ) , and prosaccade ( SAC ) . Eye-movement pattern was tested with a repeated-measures analysis of variance . Activation maps reproducibility were estimated with the cluster overlap Jaccard index and signal variance coefficient of determination for within-subjects test-retest data , and for between-subjects data from the same and different sites . In all groups latencies increased with decreasing target predictability : PRED < pPRED < tPRED < SAC ( P < 0,001 ) . Activation overlap was good to fair ( > 0.40 ) in all tasks in the within-subjects test-retest comparisons and poor ( < 0.40 ) in the tPRED for different subjects . The overlap of the different tasks for within-groups data was higher ( 0.40-0 .68 ) than for the between-groups data ( 0.30-0 .50 ) . Activation consistency was 60-85 % in the same subjects , 50-79 % in different subjects , and 50-80 % in different sites . In SAC , the activation found in the same and in different subjects was more consistent than in other tasks ( 50-80 % ) .

       " ' The cortisol awakening response ( CAR ) is a natural metabolic response that can be potentiated by negative cognitive-emotional processes , including stress appraisals , negative affect , and rumination . Psychological distress and the CAR are not consistently related , however . Individual differences in aspects of dispositional mindfulness which reflect how people relate to negative thoughts and emotions may help explain such inconsistencies . We tested whether the tendency to ( 1 ) label and describe inner experiences and ( 2 ) accept negative thoughts and feelings without judgment moderated the association between psychological distress and the CAR . Self-reported dispositional mindfulness , perceived stress , anxiety , negative affect , rumination , and the CAR were assessed among overweight/obese women . Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether dispositional mindfulness moderated the relationship between indicators of psychological distress and the CAR . While psychological distress was consistently positively related to the CAR , these associations were qualified by significant interactions with both components of dispositional mindfulness . Psychological distress was associated with the CAR at lower levels of dispositional mindfulness but not at higher levels . These findings are consistent with the idea that the tendency to describe and accept experiences may buffer the impact of psychological distress on physiological arousal . These metacognitive processes may be important moderators in unraveling the complex relationship between psychological distress and physiological stress reactivity . Further research is recommended to replicate this approach in other populations .',\n",

Horses that received saline solution were administered APS at termination of the study , and clients scored horses for lameness and discomfort before , 12 weeks after , and 52 weeks after the APS injection . The APS group had significant improvements in lameness grade , asymmetry indices of vertical peak force , and range of joint motion by 14 days , compared with baseline or control group values . No adverse effects associated with APS treatment were evident . Clients assessed lameness and comfort as improved at 12 and 52 weeks . The APS had greater likelihood ( OR , 4.3 to 30.0 ) of a therapeutic response in horses with a lameness score < 4 , < 10 % vertical force asymmetry , or absence of marked osteophyte formation , subchondral sclerosis , or joint space narrowing . Concentration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in APS was 5.8 times that in blood .

However , it is unclear whether OSA is underdiagnosed in the cardiology outpatient setting . In the present study , we prospectively evaluated the potential underdiagnosis of OSA in several subspecialties from a tertiary cardiology university hospital . Consecutive outpatients from five subspecialties ( hypertension , coronary , arrhythmia , heart failure ( HF ) , valvular heart disease ) were studied . We performed anthropometric measurements , assessed the risk of OSA using the Berlin Questionnaire and evaluated the prior diagnosis and treatment for OSA . In a subset of patients randomly selected , we performed portable sleep monitoring to objectively evaluate the presence of OSA ( defined by an apnoea-hypopnoea index 15 events/h of sleep ) . We evaluated 500 patients ( 100 from each subspecialty ) . The mean age and body mass index ( BMI ) were 5913years and 28.25.3 kg/m ( 2 ) , respectively . We found that 51.6 % ( 258 patients ) had a high risk for OSA ( Berlin Questionnaire ) . However , only 13 ( 3.1 % ) of these patients had a previous diagnosis of OSA . Of those , only six patients were receiving specific OSA treatment . Fifty patients ( 10 from each specialty ) participated in sleep studies . No differences were found in patients who underwent sleep monitoring and those who did not . We found a high frequency of OSA ( 66 % ) , varying from 50 % ( hypertension group ) to 80 % ( HF group ) . Despite significant scientific evidence pointing to OSA as an emerging cardiovascular risk factor , OSA is still underdiagnosed in several cardiology subspecialties .',\n",

Seventeen bitches of various breeds , aged 122years and weighing 106.5 kg requiring total unilateral or bilateral mastectomy . Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine ( 0.04 mgkg ( -1 ) ) and morphine ( 0.4 mgkg ( -1 ) ) intramuscularly . Anesthesia was induced with propofol ( 2.5 mgkg ( -1 ) ) and midazolam ( 0.2 mgkg ( -1 ) ) intravenously , followed by intubation and maintenance with isoflurane and TLA . Dogs were randomly allocated to receive TLA either with 0.1 % ropivacaine ( group G1 ) or with 0.05 % ropivacaine ( group G05 ) . TLA was performed by insertion of a multihole needle under the skin and infusion of ropivacaine and lactated Ringer 's solution at a fixed volume of 15mLkg ( -1 ) . Ropivacaine concentrations in arterial blood were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography . Post-operative pain was assessed using two scales ( University of Melbourne pain scale and a modified composite measure pain scale ) and von Frey filaments , 4hours after TLA and at 1hour intervals until sensitivity was regained . A score above 30 % of the maximum possible score was considered a positive indicator of pain . Peak plasma concentrations of ropivacaine were measured 240minutes after TLA in G1 . Low concentrations were measured in G05 for 60minutes , with subsequent increase . Analgesic rescue and return of sensitivity occurred at 72.3 and 71.9 hours ( mean SD ) after TLA for G1 and G05 , respectively . Tumescent local anesthesia with ropivacaine provided satisfactory post-operative analgesia that lasted for several hours , with no difference in duration between the concentrations . No serious side effects were attributed to TLA . Results indicated that 0.05 % ropivacaine provided adequate analgesia for mastectomy , however , more studies are required to support this conclusion .\",\n",
       " ' ST-segment resolution ( STR ) after reperfusion therapy has been shown to correlate with prognosis in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . We investigated whether acute ECG measurements also correlate with ultimate infarct size . The INFUSE-AMI trial randomized 452 patients with anterior STEMI to intracoronary bolus abciximab vs. no abciximab , and to thrombus aspiration vs. no aspiration . Infarct size as percentage of total LV mass was calculated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 30 days post intervention . Five ECG methods were analysed for their ability to predict MRI infarct mass : ( 1 ) summed STR across all infarct-related ECG leads ( STR ) ; ( 2 ) STR in the single lead with maximum baseline ST-segment elevation ( maxSTR ) ; ( 3 ) summed residual ST-segment elevation across all infarct-related leads at 60 min post intervention ( ST residual ) ; ( 4 ) maximum residual ST-segment elevation in the worst single lead at 60 min post intervention ( maxST residual ) ; ( 5 ) number of new significant Q-waves ( Qwave ) at 60 min . All ECG methods strongly correlated with 30-day MRI infarct mass ( all p < 0.003 ) . Simpler ECG measurements such as maxSTresidual and Qwave were as predictive as more complex measurements . A subset analysis of 158 patients who had microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) determined by MRI 5 days post intervention also showed strong correlations of MVO with the ECG measures . ST-segment and Q-wave changes after primary PCI in anterior STEMI strongly correlated with 30-day infarct size by MRI . In particular , maxST residual and Qwave at 60 min are simple ECG parameters that offer rapid analysis for prognostication .',\n",

This prospective , randomized , controlled study tested the hypothesis that an invasive treatment strategy versus continued noninvasive treatment improves health-related quality of life after 1 year in unselected patients with intermittent claudication . After clinical and duplex ultrasound assessment , unselected patients with intermittent claudication requesting treatment for claudication were randomly assigned to invasive ( n = 79 ) or noninvasive ( n = 79 ) treatment groups . Primary end point was health-related quality of life after 1 year , assessed with Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 version 1 and Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire , and secondary end points included walking distances on a graded treadmill . The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 version 1 physical component summary ( P < 0.001 ) and 2 Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 version 1 physical subscales improved significantly more in the invasive versus the noninvasive treatment group . Overall , Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire score ( P < 0.01 ) and 3 of 5 domain scores improved significantly more in the invasive versus the noninvasive treatment group . Intermittent claudication distance improved significantly in the invasive ( +124 m ) versus the noninvasive ( +50 m ) group ( P = 0.003 ) , whereas the change in maximum walking distance was not significantly different between groups . An invasive treatment strategy improves health-related quality of life and intermittent claudication distance after 1 year in patients with stable lifestyle-limiting claudication receiving current medical management . Long-term follow-up data and health-economic assessments are warranted to further establish the role for revascularization in intermittent claudication .',\n",

We did this pragmatic , randomised controlled trial between Oct 1 , 2002 , and Jan 1 , 2009 , in 19 tertiary-care centres in France , Switzerland , and Belgium . Women with singleton fetuses whose estimated weight exceeded the 95th percentile , were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) , via computer-generated permuted-block randomisation ( block size of four to eight ) to receive induction of labour within 3 days between 37 ( +0 ) weeks and 38 ( +6 ) weeks of gestation , or expectant management . Randomisation was stratified by centre . Participants and caregivers were not masked to group assignment . Our primary outcome was a composite of clinically significant shoulder dystocia , fracture of the clavicle , brachial plexus injury , intracranial haemorrhage , or death . We did analyses by intention to treat . This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00190320 . We randomly assigned 409 women to the induction group and 413 women to the expectant management group , of whom 407 women and 411 women , respectively , were included in the final analysis . Mean birthweight was 3831 g ( SD 324 ) in the induction group and 4118 g ( 392 ) in the expectant group . Induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia or associated morbidity ( n = 8 ) compared with expectant management ( n = 25 ; relative risk [ RR ] 032 , 95 % CI 015-071 ; p = 0004 ) . We recorded no brachial plexus injuries , intracranial haemorrhages , or perinatal deaths . The likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery was higher in women in the induction group than in those in the expectant management group ( RR 114 , 95 % CI 101-129 ) . Caesarean delivery and neonatal morbidity did not differ significantly between the groups . Induction of labour for suspected large-for-date fetuses is associated with a reduced risk of shoulder dystocia and associated morbidity compared with expectant management . Induction of labour does not increase the risk of caesarean delivery and improves the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery . These benefits should be balanced with the effects of early-term induction of labour . Assistance Publique-Hpitaux de Paris and the University of Geneva .',\n",
       " \" Elevated concentrations of doxorubicin are found in eccrine sweat glands of the palms and soles . We therefore evaluated an antiperspirant as preventive treatment for palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ( hand-foot syndrome ) in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin . An antiperspirant containing aluminum chlorohydrate or placebo cream was applied to the left or right hand and foot in a double-blinded manner ( intra-patient randomization ) . The primary endpoint was the rate of grade 2 or 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia . A secondary endpoint was the patient-reported symptom burden ( tingling , numbness , pain , or skin problems ) . Using McNemar 's matched pairs design , 53 patients were needed to detect a 20 % difference between the treatment and placebo sides with a significance level of 5 % and power of 90 % . Grade 2 or 3 PPE occurred in 30 ( 58 % ) of 52 evaluable patients ; in six patients adverse effects occurred on the placebo side but not on the treatment side , whereas one patient developed palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia on the treatment side only ( P = 0.07 ) . Four patients developed grade 2 or 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia on their foot on the placebo side but not on the treatment side ( P = 0.05 ) . In the cohort with grade 2 or 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia there was a trend towards fewer dermatologic symptomatologies with the active treatment ( P = 0.05 ) , and no difference for other adverse events . Using topical aluminum chlorohydrate as an antiperspirant appears to reduce the incidence of grade 2 or 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia following pegylated liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer .\",\n",
       " \" Methotrexate is the most frequently used first-line antirheumatic drug . We report the findings of a phase 3 study of monotherapy with tofacitinib , an oral Janus kinase inhibitor , as compared with methotrexate monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had not previously received methotrexate or therapeutic doses of methotrexate . We randomly assigned 958 patients to receive 5 mg or 10 mg of tofacitinib twice daily or methotrexate at a dose that was incrementally increased to 20 mg per week over 8 weeks ; 956 patients received a study drug . The coprimary end points at month 6 were the mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score ( which ranges from 0 to 448 , with higher scores indicating greater structural joint damage ) and the proportion of patients with an American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) 70 response ( 70 % reduction in the number of both tender and swollen joints and 70 % improvement in three of five other criteria : the patient 's assessment of pain , level of disability , C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate , global assessment of disease by the patient , and global assessment of disease by the physician ) . Mean changes in the modified total Sharp score from baseline to month 6 were significantly smaller in the tofacitinib groups than in the methotrexate group , but changes were modest in all three groups ( 0.2 points in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and < 0.1 point in the 10-mg tofacitinib group , as compared with 0.8 points in the methotrexate group [ P < 0.001 for both comparisons ] ) . Among the patients receiving tofacitinib , 25.5 % in the 5-mg group and 37.7 % in the 10-mg group had an ACR 70 response at month 6 , as compared with 12.0 % of patients in the methotrexate group ( P < 0.001 for both comparisons ) . Herpes zoster developed in 31 of 770 patients who received tofacitinib ( 4.0 % ) and in 2 of 186 patients who received methotrexate ( 1.1 % ) . Confirmed cases of cancer ( including three cases of lymphoma ) developed in 5 patients who received tofacitinib and in 1 patient who received methotrexate . Tofacitinib was associated with increases in creatinine levels and in low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels . In patients who had not previously received methotrexate or therapeutic doses of methotrexate , tofacitinib monotherapy was superior to methotrexate in reducing signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage . The benefits of tofacitinib need to be considered in the context of the risks of adverse events . ( Funded by Pfizer ; ORAL Start ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01039688 . )\",\n",
       " ' Depression is common and the efficacy of antidepressants is suboptimal . High plasma homocysteine has been consistently associated with depression , and treatment with certain B vitamins demonstrably reduces its concentration . To determine whether vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid enhance response to antidepressant treatment over 52 weeks . Randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of citalopram ( 20-40 g ) together with 0.5 mg of vitamin B12 , 2 mg of folic acid and 25 mg of vitamin B6 for 52 weeks ( Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry : 12609000256279 ) . Participants were community-dwelling adults aged 50 years or over with DSM-IV-TR major depression . We measured severity of symptoms with the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . The primary outcome was remission of the depressive episode after 12 , 26 and 52 weeks . Secondary outcomes included reduction of MADRS scores over time and relapse of major depression after recovery by week 12 . Results In total , 153 people were randomised ( 76 placebo , 77 vitamins ) . Remission of symptoms was achieved by 78.1 and 79.4 % of participants treated with placebo and vitamins by week 12 ( P = 0.840 ) , by 76.5 and 85.3 % at week 26 and 75.8 and 85.5 % at week 52 ( effect of intervention over 52 weeks : odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.49 , 95 % CI 1.12-5 .51 ) . Group differences in MADRS scores over time were not significant ( P = 0.739 ) . The risk of subsequent relapse among those who had achieved remission of symptoms at week 12 was lower in the vitamins than placebo group ( OR = 0.33 , 95 % CI 0.12-0 .94 ) . B vitamins did not increase the 12-week efficacy of antidepressant treatment , but enhanced and sustained antidepressant response over 1 year . Replication of these findings would mandate that treatment guidelines adopt the adjunctive use of B vitamins as a safe and inexpensive strategy to manage major depression in middle-aged and older adults .',\n",
       " \" The Veterans Administration Cooperative Studies Program # 468 , a multicenter study that randomized Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients to either subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) or globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , found that stimulation at either target provided similar overall motoric benefits . We conducted an additional analysis of this data set to evaluate whether PD motor subtypes responded differently to the 2 stimulation targets . We classified 235 subjects by motor subtype : tremor dominant ( TD ) , intermediate ( I ) , or postural instability gait difficulty ( PIGD ) , based on pre-DBS baseline Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) scores off-medication . The primary outcome was change in UPDRS part III ( UPDRS-III ) off-medication scores from baseline to 24 months post-DBS , compared among subjects with particular PD motor subtypes and by DBS target ( STN vs GPi ) . Changes in tremor , rigidity , akinesia , and gait scores were also assessed using the UPDRS . TD patients had greater mean overall motor improvement , measured by UPDRS-III , after GPi DBS , compared to STN DBS ( 17.513.0 vs 14.614.9 , p = 0.02 ) , with improvement in gait accounting for this difference . Regardless of stimulation target , PIGD subjects had lower mean overall improvement in UPDRS-III scores compared with I or TD subjects ( 8.712.2 vs 21.711.2 vs 16.313.8 , p = 0.001 ) . Our results suggest that responsiveness to both GPi and STN DBS is similar among different PD motor subtypes , although the TD motor subtype may have a greater response to GPi DBS with respect to gait . PIGD patients obtained less overall benefit from stimulation .\",\n",

We prospectively treated 75 consecutive patients ( 51 females , 24 males , mean age standard deviation = 45.39.8 years ) with DQD . Patients ' features ( hand dominance , intraretinaculum septum , accessory tendons ) were recorded . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , reduced disability ( quickDASH ) score , and retinaculum thickness were evaluated at baseline and after one ( excluding retinaculum thickness ) , three , and six months . Patients were randomized into three groups of 25 patients each treated under ultrasound guidance : Group A ( 1 ml methylprednisolone acetate ; mean baseline thickness = 1.6 mm ; mean baseline VAS = 6 ; mean baseline quickDASH = 55 ) ; Group B ( 1 ml methylprednisolone acetate +15 - day delayed 2 ml saline 0.9 % ; 1.4 ; 6 ; 56 ) ; Group C ( 1 ml methylprednisolone acetate +15 - day delayed 2 ml low molecular weight hyaluronic acid ; 1.7 ; 6 ; 55 ) . After one month results were : Group A mean VAS = 2 ; mean quickDASH = 23 ; Group B 2 ; 22 ; Group C 2 ; 21 . After three months results were : Group A retinaculum thickness = 0.7 mm ; 3 ; 27 ) ; Group B 0.8 mm ; 1 ; 25 ; Group C 0.5 mm ; 1 ; 23 . After six months results were : Group A 1.5 mm ; 3 ; 51 ; Group B 1 mm ; 2 ; 51 ; Group C 0.7 mm ; 1 ; 26 ( P < 0.001 for all vs. baseline ) . Patients ' age , sex , hand dominance , presence of subcompartment dividing septum , and supernumerary tendons had no influence on outcome ( P 0.177 ) . Addition of hyaluronic acid to ultrasound-guided injections of steroids to treat DQD seems to improve the outcome and to reduce the recurrence rate . Ultrasound guidance allows for safe injection procedures to treat de Quervains ' disease Steroid injections allow prompt recovery in de Quervain 's disease with short-term recurrence Addition of hyaluronic acid allows recurrence rate reduction compared to simple steroid injections .\",\n",
       " ' Older individuals often have a reduced immune response to influenza vaccination , which might be improved by administering a higher vaccine dose . We compared the immune response to two single doses of the AS03A-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic vaccine ( 3.75 g hemagglutinin of A/Vietnam/1194 / 2004 ) with that of two double vaccine doses ( 7.5 g hemagglutinin ) in adults aged 61 years . Here we report the 2-year persistence of the humoral and cellular immune response . In this phase II , open-label study , healthy participants aged 61 to 88 years ( median 68 years ) were randomised ( 3:1:3:1 ) to receive two single doses of the AS03A-adjuvanted vaccine ( 1xH5N1-AS ) or the non-adjuvanted vaccine ( 1xH5N1 ) , or two double doses of the AS03A-adjuvanted vaccine ( 2xH5N1-AS ) or the non-adjuvanted vaccine ( 2xH5N1 ) , 21 days apart . Serum haemagglutination inhibition antibodies and cellular immune responses against A/Vietnam/1194 / 2004 were measured in all groups at months 12 and 24 ; neutralising antibodies were assessed in a subset of the adjuvanted groups . Serious adverse events and adverse events of specific interest were recorded . At month 24 , haemagglutination inhibition antibody seroprotection rates were 37.2 % ( 95 % CI 27.0 % to 48.3 % ) for 1xH5N1-AS , 30.9 % ( 95 % CI 21.1 % to 42.1 % ) for 2xH5N1-AS , 16.2 % ( 95 % CI 6.2 % to 32.0 % ) for 1xH5N1 , and 8.3 % ( 95 % CI 1.0 % to 27.0 % ) for 2xH5N1 .

       " ' School-based mass treatment with praziquantel is the cornerstone for schistosomiasis control in school-aged children . However , uptake of treatment among school-age children in Uganda is low in some areas . The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a pre-treatment snack on uptake of mass treatment . In a cluster randomized trial carried out in Jinja district , Uganda , 12 primary schools were randomized into two groups ; one received education messages for schistosomiasis prevention for two months prior to mass treatment , while the other , in addition to the education messages , received a pre-treatment snack shortly before mass treatment . Four weeks after mass treatment , uptake of praziquantel was assessed among a random sample of 595 children in the snack schools and 689 children in the non-snack schools as the primary outcome . The occurrence of side effects and the prevalence and mean intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection were determined as the secondary outcomes . Uptake of praziquantel was higher in the snack schools , 93.9 % ( 95 % CI 91.7 % -95.7 % ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , 78.7 % ( 95 % CI 75.4 % -81.7 % ) ( p = 0.002 ) . The occurrence of side effects was lower in the snack schools , 34.4 % ( 95 % CI 31.5 % -39.8 % ) , compared to that in the non-snack schools , 46.9 % ( 95 % CI 42.2 % -50.7 % ) ( p = 0.041 ) .

       " ' The tradeoff between stent thrombosis ( ST ) and major bleeding ( MB ) of 12 - versus 6-month dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) after coronary stent implantation has not been clearly defined . Definite/probable ST and MB ( TIMI major and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ( BARC ) 3 ) were compared in 2 subsequent trials with similar inclusion criteria but different DAPT duration , that is , BASKET ( 6 months ; n = 557 ) and BASKET-PROVE ( 12 months ; n = 2,314 ) , between months 0 to 6 ( DAPT in both trials ) , 7 to 12 ( DAPT in BASKET-PROVE only ) , and 13 to 24 ( aspirin in both trials ) using propensity score-adjusted , time-stratified Cox proportional hazard models . Overall , event rates were low with fewer ST but similar MB in prolonged DAPT . Analysis of the 3 periods showed a uniform pattern for ST ( interaction DAPT/period ; P = .145 ) but an inconsistent pattern for MB ( interaction DAPT/period ; P < .001 for TIMI major and P = .046 for BARC 3 ) , with more MB occurring during months 7 to 12 with prolonged DAPT . Considering observed case fatality rates of 31 % with ST and 11 % with MB , the extrapolated prevention of 27 ST deaths and the excess of 5 MB deaths resulted in an expected benefit of 22 survivors/10 ,000 patients treated over 2 years with prolonged DAPT . Despite overall low event rates , prolonged DAPT was associated with more MB during months 7 to 12 according to the interaction DAPT/period . Given the higher observed case fatality rates of ST versus MB , 12 - versus 6-month DAPT was associated with an extrapolated reduction in mortality . Effective treatment periods and case fatality rates seem important in the analysis of different DAPT durations , specifically with regard to ongoing trials .',\n",

For every one patient with a port infection , two control subjects were chosen of the same gender and new port placement during the same month as the corresponding patient with an infected port . From 2002-2009 , 4,404 ports were placed . Of the 4,404 patients , 33 ( 0.7 % ) were found to have a port infection within 30 days of placement . Compared with the control group , the early infection group had a higher prevalence of leukopenia ( 21.2 % vs 6.1 % , P = .039 ) and thrombocytopenia ( 33 % vs 12 % , P = .0158 ) . There was also a higher prevalence of an inpatient hospital stay during port placement and high international normalized ratio in the early infection group . Low preoperative white blood cell and platelet counts were risk factors for early infection .

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of education provided by nurses on the QOL in patients with CHF in home-visit care compared to usual care . In a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted from September 2011 to June 2012 , 110 patients with CHF were randomly assigned into two groups . While patients in group I were received usual education at the time of hospital discharge , patients in Group II , in addition to usual education , were received special education regards to their illness by nurses who visited patients in their homes . The 36-item short-form ( SF-36 ) questionnaire was used to evaluate the patient 's QOL at the time of discharge and also six months after hospital discharge . At the time of hospital discharge , mean score of all 8 sub-score of SF-36 questionnaire was 63.47.8 in patients of group II and 61.16.4 in patients of group I , respectively ( P > 0.05 ) . QOL was decreased in group I and increased in group II compared to the time of hospital discharge . After six months , mean score of QOL was higher in group II than in group I. QOL of patients with CHF were decreased after hospital discharge .

       " ' The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90 % for children with bronchiolitis , which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections . No evidence exists to support this threshold . We aimed to assess whether the 90 % or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94 % or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis . We did a parallel-group , randomised , controlled , equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK ( the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [ BIDS ] ) . A central computer randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) infants , in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification , to be clipped to standard oximeters ( patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [ SpO2 ] < 94 % ) or modified oximeters ( displayed a measured value of 90 % as 94 % , therefore oxygen not given until SpO2 < 90 % ) . All parents , clinical staff , and outcome assessors were masked to allocation . The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough ( prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days ) in the intention-to-treat population . This trial is registered with ISRCTN , number ISRCTN28405428 . Between Oct 3 , and March 30 , 2012 , and Oct 1 , and March 29 , 2013 , we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters . Cough resolved by 150 days ( median ) in both groups ( 95 % CI for difference -1 to 2 ) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent . We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group . In the standard care group , eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit , 23 were readmitted , and one had a prolonged hospital stay . In the modified care group , 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital . Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly . Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90 % or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94 % or higher .

In a parallel , single-blinded , randomized controlled study , 55 F-16 pilots were evaluated at baseline and randomized to a control group ( CG ; N = 28 ) or training group ( TG ; N = 27 ) . Postural control was tested in four different settings : Romberg with open and closed eyes , unilateral stance , and perturbation . Maximal voluntary contraction and force steadiness was measured for shoulder elevation . At follow-up , there was a significant between-group difference in the Romberg test with closed eyes only ( 95 % confidence ellipse area ; CG : 761 + / - 311 mm2 ; TG : 650 + / - 405 mm2 ) . Prior to randomization , there were no significant differences in postural control and steadiness between 30 pilots who experienced neck pain within the previous 3 mo and 25 pilots without such pain . Impaired postural control and steadiness may only be quantifiable in individuals experiencing acute neck pain of certain intensity , and there may be a ceiling effect in the ability to improve these parameters . For individuals with highly developed physiological capacity , a battery of tests with more stringent demands should be considered , e.g. , increased number of repetitions , prolonged duration of the tests , or testing with eyes closed .',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study was to assess the degree of fluctuation of osteitis on MRI during long-term treatment with etanercept ( ETN ) in patients with early axial SpA ( axSpA ) with active inflammation ( osteitis ) on whole-body MRI in the spine and/or the SI joints at baseline . We analysed MRI data from 328 SI joint quadrants and 943 spine vertebral units ( VUs ) in terms of osteitis in the pooled data set of 41 patients who were treated with ETN for 3 consecutive years . Scoring was performed by two blinded radiologists at baseline , year 2 and year 3 . Through years 2 and 3 , osteitis on MRI resolved completely in 56 of 144 ( 38.9 % ) SI joint quadrants and in 20 of 40 ( 50 % ) VUs affected at baseline , while persistent osteitis was found in 24 of 144 ( 16.7 % ) SI joint quadrants and in 8 of 40 ( 20.0 % ) spine VUs . The development of new osteitis in sites that were free of osteitis at baseline only occurred in 2 of 131 ( 1.5 % ) SI joint quadrants and in 3 of 862 ( 0.4 % ) spine VUs in both year 2 and year 3 . There was a consistently small amount of osteitis on MRI in patients with early axSpA compared with baseline values , and only a very low rate of new-onset osteitis was found during 3 years of continuous treatment with ETN . www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT00844142 .',\n",
       " ' Current tobacco use treatment approaches require smokers to request treatment or depend on the provider to initiate smoking cessation care and are therefore reactive . Most smokers do not receive evidence-based treatments for tobacco use that include both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy . To assess the effect of a proactive , population-based tobacco cessation care model on use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments and on population-level smoking cessation rates ( ie , abstinence among all smokers including those who use and do not use treatment ) compared with usual care among a diverse population of current smokers . The Veterans Victory Over Tobacco Study , a pragmatic randomized clinical trial involving a population-based registry of current smokers aged 18 to 80 years . A total of 6400 current smokers , identified using the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) electronic medical record , were randomized prior to contact to evaluate both the reach and effectiveness of the proactive care intervention . Current smokers were randomized to usual care or proactive care . Proactive care combined ( 1 ) proactive outreach and ( 2 ) offer of choice of smoking cessation services ( telephone or in-person ) . Proactive outreach included mailed invitations followed by telephone outreach to motivate smokers to seek treatment with choice of services . The primary outcome was 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence at 1 year and was assessed by a follow-up survey among all current smokers regardless of interest in quitting or treatment utilization . A total of 5123 participants were included in the primary analysis . The follow-up survey response rate was 66 % . The population-level , 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence rate at 1 year was 13.5 % for proactive care compared with 10.9 % for usual care ( P = .02 ) . Logistic regression mixed model analysis showed a significant effect of the proactive care intervention on 6-month prolonged abstinence ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.27 [ 95 % CI , 1.03-1 .57 ] ) . In analyses accounting for nonresponse using likelihood-based not-missing-at-random models , the effect of proactive care on 6-month prolonged abstinence persisted ( OR , 1.33 [ 95 % CI , 1.17-1 .51 ] ) . Proactive , population-based tobacco cessation care using proactive outreach to connect smokers to evidence-based telephone or in-person smoking cessation services is effective for increasing long-term population-level cessation rates . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00608426 .',\n",

Tampere , Finland . Women aged 70 to 80 who had fallen in the previous year ( n = 409 ) . Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise or control group ( ClinicalTrial.gov NCT00986466 ) . Exercisers participated in group exercise classes twice a week for 12 months and once a week for the subsequent 12 months and home exercises . Controls maintained their current physical activity . Physical functioning assessed at baseline and at 6-month intervals during the intervention . Falls and related injuries monitored with fall diaries . Intention-to-treat analyses showed that exercise led to significant improvements in physical functioning . Leg strength differed significantly between the groups ( mean change : 14.1 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 8.0 to 20.2 in exercisers ; 1.6 % , 95 % CI = -4.5 to 7.7 in controls ; P < .001 ) . Chair stand time also differed significantly between groups ( 7.4 % , 95 % CI 3.8 to 10.8 % in exercisers ; 2.4 % , 95 % CI = -1.6 to 6.2 ) in controls ; P = .02 ) . Between-group differences were significant for fast walking speed ( P = .003 ) and probability of completing the backward walking test ( P < .001 ) , favoring exercisers . Timed Up-and-Go and grip strength did not differ between groups . There was no difference in the total falls incidence rate ratio ( IRR = 1.0 , 95 % CI = 0.79 to 1.26 ) , but exercisers were less likely to have medically attended injurious falls ( IRR = 0.45 , 95 % CI = 0.27 to 0.78 ; P = .004 ) . Twenty-four months of multimodal exercise enhanced physical functioning in women aged 70 to 80 with a history of falls . Although the total number of falls was not lower than in controls , the rate of medically attended injurious falls was more than 50 % lower .',\n",

To compare the effect of X-Stop with minimally invasive decompression ( MID ) in patients with neurogenic intermittent claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis . Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common indication for operative treatment in elderly . Laminectomy has been the `` gold standard , '' but MID is now widely used . Another minimally invasive surgery option is X-Stop showing good result compared with nonoperative treatment , but showing higher reoperation rate than laminectomy . We enrolled 96 patients aged 50 to 85 years , with symptoms of neurogenic intermittent claudication within 250-m walking distance and 1 - or 2-level lumbar spinal stenosis , randomized to either MID or X-Stop . Primary outcome was Zurich Claudication Questionnaire in this intention-to-treat analysis . Secondary outcome was Oswestry Disability Index , EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire , numerical rating scale 11 for lower back pain and leg pain , and risk for secondary surgery and complications . No significant differences were found in Zurich Claudication Questionnaire between the groups at any follow-ups . Both groups had a statistical and clinical significant improvement at 6 weeks and throughout the 2-year observation period . The number of patients having secondary surgery due to persistent or recurrent symptoms was significantly higher in the X-Stop group , odds ratio ( 95 % confidence interval ) = 6.5 ( 1.3-31 .9 ) .

The effect of antimicrobial treatment on the duration of middle ear effusion ( MEE ) and concomitant hearing impairment is not known . To determine whether the antimicrobial treatment of AOM reduces the duration of MEE . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial involved a total of 84 children with AOM between 6 months and 15 years of age . Participants were recruited from September 14 , 1999 , to January 4 , 2000 ; October 10 , 2005 , to December 16 , 2005 ; and September 22 , 2009 , to June 4 , 2012 , from among children attending an AOM prevention trial and children visiting local outpatient clinics in Oulu , Finland . Children were randomly allocated to receive either 40 mg/kg of amoxicillin-clavulanate or a placebo mixture per day for 7 days . The primary outcome measure was the time to the disappearance of MEE as defined by a normal tympanogram finding ( A curve ) from both ears on 2 consecutive measurement days . Parents performed daily tympanometry at home . The study physician performed tympanometry and otoscopy at study entry , after 3 and 7 days , and then weekly until both ears were healthy . The main secondary outcome measures were the time to normal otoscopy findings and the proportion of children without persistent MEE at 14 days and 2 months . Middle ear effusion disappeared 2.0 weeks ( 13.7 days ) earlier ( P = .02 ) in the antimicrobial group ( mean time , 2.7 weeks ; 95 % CI , 1.7-3 .7 ) than in the placebo group ( 4.7 weeks ; 95 % CI , 3.6-5 .7 ) . Normal otoscopy findings were observed 1.4 weeks sooner in the antimicrobial group than in the placebo group ( P = .02 ) .

We performed a prospective double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intraoperative corticosteroid PI in patients undergoing TKA . Seventy-six consecutive female patients undergoing bilateral staged TKA were randomized to receive steroid or non-steroid PI , with 3 months separating the procedures . The steroid group received PI with a mixture containing triamcinolone acetonide ( 40 mg ) . The non-steroid group received the same injection mixture without corticosteroid . During the postoperative period , nighttime pain , functional recovery [ straight leg raising ( SLR ) ability and maximal flexion ] , patient satisfaction , and complications were recorded . Short-term postoperative clinical scores and patient satisfaction were evaluated at 6 months . The pain level was significantly lower in the PI steroid than the non-steroid group on the night of the operation ( VAS , 1.2 vs. 2.3 ; p = 0.021 ) . Rebound pain was observed in both groups at POD1 ( VAS , 3.2 vs. 3.8 ; p = 0.248 ) , but pain remained at a low level thereafter . No significant differences were seen in maximal flexion , frequency of acute rescuer , clinical scores , and patient satisfaction . The steroid group was able to perform SLR earlier than the non-steroid group ( p = 0.013 ) . The incidence of complications was similar between the groups .

Our further goal was to improve objective speech measures and gain insight into muscle functioning before and after treatment . In 34 patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal , nasal or nasopharyngeal , or oral or oropharyngeal cancer , we acoustically analyzed nasality , vowel space , precision , and strength of articulation in 12 speech sounds ( / a / , / i / , / u / , / p / , / s / , / z / , / 1 / , / t / , / tj / , / k / , / x / , / r / ) before treatment and 10 weeks and 1 year after treatment . Outcomes were compared between assessment points and between tumor sites . Nasality in nonlaryngeal sites was significantly reduced by treatment . Most affected in articulation were the oral or oropharyngeal cancer sites , followed by the nasal or nasopharyngeal sites . One year after treatment , vowel space had not recovered and consonant articulation had weakened . Laryngeal sites were less affected in articulation by tumor or treatment . Analyses of articulatory-acoustic features are a useful instrument for assessing articulation and speech quality objectively . Assessment of a number of sounds representing various articulation manners , places , and tongue shapes revealed patterns of speech deterioration after chemoradiotherapy . The results suggest that patients ' speech could benefit from articulation exercises to address changes in muscle coordination and/or sensitivity and to counteract side effects and `` underexercise '' atrophy .\",\n",

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial , 62 diabetic kidney transplant patients were followed for 4 months after randomly assigned to placebo and pioglitazone ( 30 mg/d ) groups . All of the patients continued their insulin therapy irrespective of the group that they were assigned to , in order to evaluate the effects of addition of pioglitazone on blood glucose and inflammation biomarkers including serum C-reactive protein , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , and interleukin-18 levels , as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate . At baseline , there were no significant differences in laboratory studies between the two groups . After 4 months of intervention , along with significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in the pioglitazone group , daily insulin requirements also decreased and lipid profile improved significantly . In addition , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , C-reactive protein , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein values were significantly lower in the pioglitazone group ( P = .03 , P < .001 , and P = .01 ) . Interleukin-18 levels were not significantly different at the end of the study between the two groups , but it had a decreasing trend in the pioglitazone group ( P = .002 ) . Pioglitazone complementing insulin in diabetic kidney transplant patients not only improved glycemic control , evidenced by hemoglobin A1c , and reduced daily insulin requirement , but also decreased inflammatory markers which may have an impact on overall cardiovascular events and mortalities beyond glycemic control .',\n",

To test the effect of very low-intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation on symptoms associated with fibromyalgia syndrome . A double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in the Sagrado Corazn Hospital , Seville , Spain . Female fibromyalgia patients ( 22 to 50 years of age ) were randomly assigned to either a stimulation group or a sham group . The stimulation group ( n = 28 ) was stimulated using 8 Hz pulsed magnetic fields of very low intensity , while the sham group ( n = 26 ) underwent the same protocol without stimulation . Pressure pain thresholds before and after stimulation were determined using an algometer during the eight consecutive weekly sessions of the trial . In addition , blood serotonin levels were measured and patients completed questionnaires to monitor symptom evolution . A repeated-measures ANOVA indicated statistically significant improvement in the stimulation group compared with the control group with respect to somatosensory pain thresholds , ability to perform daily activities , perceived chronic pain and sleep quality . While improvement in pain thresholds was apparent after the first stimulation session , improvement in the other three measures occurred after the sixth week . No significant between-group differences were observed in scores of depression , fatigue , severity of headaches or serotonin levels . No adverse side effects were reported in any of the patients . Very low-intensity magnetic stimulation may represent a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain and other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia .',\n",

Early detection and management of individuals at risk for CMD is required to prevent future health problems with associated costs . General practice is the optimal health care setting to accomplish this goal . Prevention programs for identification and treatment of patients with an increased risk for CMD in primary care have been proven feasible . However , the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness have yet to be demonstrated . The ` Personalized Prevention Approach for CardioMetabolic Risk ' ( PPA CMR ) is such a prevention program . The objective of the INTEGRATE study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PPA CMR , as well as to establish determinants for participation and compliance . The INTEGRATE study is designed as a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with a waiting list control group . In approximately 40 general practices , all enlisted patients without CMD aged 45-70 years , are invited to participate in PPA CMR . After an online risk estimation , patients with a score above risk threshold are invited to the GP for additional measurements , detailed risk profiling and tailored treatment of risk factors through medication and/or lifestyle counseling . At baseline and after twelve months of follow-up lifestyle , health and work status of all participants are established with online questionnaires . Additionally after twelve months , we will determine health care utilization , costs of PPA CMR and compliance . Primary endpoints are the number of newly detected patients with CMD and changes in individual risk factors between the intervention and waiting list control group . Medical data will be extracted from the GPs ' electronic medical records . In order to assess factors related to participation , we will send questionnaires to non-participants and assess characteristics of participating practices . For all participants , additional demographic characteristics will be available through Statistics Netherlands .

Participants were randomized to receive one of eight combinations of three interventions : a prior-notification postcard or no contact , a standard or professionally designed consent pack , and a phone or postal reminder . The primary outcome was return of the consent form ( `` response '' ) , with consent decision being the secondary outcome . Of 1,950 participants , 806 ( 41 % ) responded . Response rates were 2.7 % higher ( 95 % confidence interval : -0.06 , 5.5 % ; P = 0.06 ) among those receiving designed packs than among those receiving standard packs and 6.4 % higher ( 2.3 , 10.6 % ; P = 0.002 ) among those receiving phone reminders ( compared with postal reminders ) . The prior-notification postcard did not influence response rates [ difference = 0 % ( -2.8 , 2.8 % ; P = 1.0 ) ] , and we found no evidence that the communication method influenced consent decision . This trial provides evidence that communication material design can influence response rates and that phone reminders have superior cost/benefit returns over designed materials .

       " ' Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease to complicate pregnancies worldwide , affecting around 12 % of pregnant women in Australia . Oxidative stress and inflammation manifest during pregnancy ; however asthma in pregnancies further intensifies oxidative stress . Consumption of antioxidant-rich foods has been shown to be beneficial for asthma control in non-pregnant asthmatic adults . It has not been investigated whether antioxidant-rich foods can improve the elevated oxidative stress that occurs with asthma in pregnancy , thereby improving asthma control . The primary aim of this study is to determine whether increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods for 12 weeks will improve maternal asthma control , compared to standard dietary intake during pregnancy . A 12 week , parallel randomized controlled trial will be conducted . One hundred and sixty eight pregnant women with mild , moderate , or severe asthma , currently using inhaled corticosteroids , and with poor diet quality , will be recruited at approximately12 weeks gestation . Following a 4 week run-in period , women will be randomized to either a 12 week antioxidant intervention ( increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods ( 5 servings/day vegetables , 2 servings/day fruit , 8 servings/day grains ( mostly wholegrains ) , 3-4 serving/week lean meat ) or standard pregnancy care . The primary outcome is asthma control score ( decrease of 0.5 , the minimally clinically significant change ) . Secondary outcomes include plasma antioxidants , markers of oxidative stress , and time to , and number of , exacerbations . With two-tailed t-tests at 80 % power , a sample size of 52 completions per group is required . Allowing for a 78 % retention including a 20 % removal of women from the analysis due to non-compliance , we will recruit 168 women . It is expected that this 12 week study will improve asthma control . This is significant because asthma is the most prevalent condition to complicate pregnancies and contributes to poor maternal , neonatal and infant health outcomes . Our research will provide the first evidence to show that , in pregnancy , consumption of antioxidant-rich foods is a key modifier of clinical asthma status .

       " ' Curative treatment of upper gastrointestinal tract neoplasms is complex and associated with high morbidity and mortality . In general , the patients are already malnourished , and early postoperative enteral nutrition is recommended . However , there is no consensus concerning the best enteral access route in these cases . A prospective randomized trial was performed from 2008 to 2012 with 59 patients who underwent esophagectomy , total gastrectomy , or pancreaticoduodenectomy . In all , 4 patients declined to participate , and 13 did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded . Of the 42 included patients , 21 had nasoenteric tubes , and 21 had a jejunostomy . The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical aspects . The nasoenteric ( NE ) and jejunostomy groups underwent early enteral therapy in 71 and 62 % of cases ( p > 0.05 ) , respectively . The median length of enteral therapy use was less in the NE group ( 5.0 vs. 8.5 days ) , but the difference was not statistically significant . The NE group required introduction of parenteral therapy more frequently than the jejunostomy group ( p < 0.05 ) . Complications related to the enteral route occurred in 38.0 and 28.5 % of patients ( p > 0.05 ) in the NE and jejunostomy groups , respectively . In the NE group , there were four losses and four tube obstructions . In the jejunostomy group , there were two losses , four obstructions , and two cases of leakage around the tube . In the latter group , patients who underwent therapy for a longer time had tubal complications ( p < 0.05 ) and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays ( p < 0.05 ) . The two enteral routes were associated with the same number of complications . However , the presence of a jejunostomy allowed enteral therapy for longer periods , especially in patients with complications , thus avoiding the need for parenteral nutrition .',\n",
       " ' To assess the efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab ( IVB ) compared with ranibizumab ( IVR ) in the treatment of macular oedema due to branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . In this prospective , randomised , non-inferiority trial , 75 participants with macular oedema due to BRVO received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab after 1:1 block randomisation . The primary outcome measure was the difference in mean changes in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) at 6months . Secondary outcome measures included mean change in central retinal thickness ( CRT ) , the proportion of patients improving by > 15 letters and the proportion of patients developing neovascularisation . Participants received either IVR ( n = 37 ) or IVB ( n = 38 ) . The mean BCVA at baseline was 52.814.4 letters ( 20/80 ) and 56.110.0 letters ( 20/80 ) ( p = 0.24 ) in the ranibizumab and bevacizumab groups , respectively . At 6months , the mean gains in BCVA were +18.1 letters ( p < 0.0001 ; 95 % CI , +12.8 to +22.6 ) in the ranibizumab group and +15.6 letters ( p < 0.0001 ; 95 % CI +12.0 to +20.5 ) in the bevacizumab group . The difference between the mean visual gains of the treated groups ( bevacizumab-ranibizumab ) was -2.5 letters ( 95 % CI -8.0 to +5.0 ; p = 0.74 ) . Mean reductions in CRT at 6months were 177.1122.3 m in the ranibizumab group ( p < 0.0001 ) and 201.7166.2 m in the bevacizumab group ( p < 0.0001 ) , with no significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.48 ) . The mean numbers of ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections were 3.21.5 and 3.01.4 , respectively ( p = 0.55 ) . Two serious adverse events occurred in the ranibizumab group and one in the bevacizumab group but both were unrelated to intravitreal injections .

We obtained the genetic data from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility ( CGEMS ) , a nested case control study examining germ-line DNA in the screened arm of the PLCO trial . A PGS-33 was calculated based on their genotype at 33 PCa associated single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) . The primary outcome was the diagnosis of PCa and primary predictor was PGS-33 . We identified 2,244 subjects ( no cancer , N = 1017 ) and cases ( N = 1227 ) . The PGS-33 ( P < 0.001 ) , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ; P < 0.001 ) , family history of PCa ( < 0.001 ) , abnormal digital rectal exam ( DRE , P < 0.001 ) , and history of ever smoking ( P = 0.037 ) were associated with a PCa diagnosis . In multivariable analysis , the log ( PGS-33 ) was associated with PCa diagnosis with an odds ratio of 1.68 ( 95 % CI 1.36-2 .08 , P < 0.001 ) , log ( PSA ) ( OR 8.2 ; 95 % CI 6.75-10 .04 , P < 0.001 ) , and family history of PCa ( OR 2.01 ; 95 % CI 1.26-3 .20 , P = 0.003 ) . PGS-33 quartiles noted an increasing rate of PCa detection in addition to PSA : 43.2 % ( Q1 ) , 47.8 % ( Q2 ) , 58.8 % ( Q3 ) , and 69.4 ( Q4 ) ( P < 0.001 ) and improvement in PSA performance ( P < 0.001 ) . Germ-line DNA in the form of the PGS-33 is able to risk stratify men regarding their risk of PCa . The PGS-33 may have implications regarding who may benefit most from PCa screening and possibly add to PSA performance .',\n",

This study 's aim was to determine if treatment with sertraline ( SERT ) or SERT plus gabapentin ( GBP ) improved treatment retention , depressive symptoms , and/or cocaine use . Depressed cocaine-dependent patients ( N = 99 ) were enrolled in a 12-week , double-blind , randomized , placebo ( PLA ) - controlled , clinical trial and placed in research beds at a residential treatment facility ( Recovery Centers of Arkansas ) . They were randomized by depressive symptom severity and inducted onto 1 of the following while residing at the Recovery Centers of Arkansas : SERT ( 200 mg/d ) , SERT ( 200 mg/d ) plus GBP ( 1200 mg/d ) , or PLA . Participants transferred to outpatient treatment at the start of their third week , continued receiving study medications or PLA ( weeks 3-12 ) , and participated in weekly individual cognitive behavioral therapy . Compliance was facilitated through the use of contingency management procedures . Supervised urine samples were obtained thrice weekly and self-reported mood weekly . At the end of 12 weeks , participants were tapered off the study medication over 5 days and referred to a local treatment program . Sertraline , but not SERT plus GBP , showed a significantly lower overall percentage of cocaine-positive urine samples compared with that of PLA . A significantly greater percentage of participants experienced relapse in the PLA group ( 88.9 % ) compared with that of the SERT group ( 65.2 % ) . Hamilton depression ratings decreased significantly over time regardless of the treatment group . Retention in treatment did not differ significantly between the treatment groups .

Forty-four ( 44 ) intrabony defects in 30 patients ( 15 males ) were randomly allocated into two treatment groups : EMD ( n = 22 ) and PRF ( n = 22 ) . Measurement of the defects was done using clinical and cone beam computed tomography at baseline and 6 months . Clinical and radiographic parameters such as probing depth , clinical attachment level , intrabony defect depth and defect angle , were recorded at baseline and 6 months post-operatively . Within group change was evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test . Intergroup comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test . Postsurgical measurements revealed that there was an equal reduction in probing depth and a greater but statistically non-significant attachment gain for the Emdogain group when compared to the platelet-rich fibrin group . The Emdogain group presented with significantly greater percentage defect resolution ( 43.07 % 12.21 ) than did the platelet-rich fibrin group ( 32.41 % 14.61 ) . Post-operatively the changes in defect width and defect angle were significant in both groups , but upon intergroup comparison they were found to be statistically non-significantly different . Both Emdogain and platelet-rich fibrin were effective in the regeneration of intrabony defects . Emdogain was significantly superior in terms of percentage defect resolution .',\n",
       " ' HM30181 is a third generation P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) inhibitor currently under development . The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a single dose of HM30181 on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of loperamide , a P-gp substrate , and to compare them with those of quinidine . Eighteen healthy male subjects were administered loperamide alone ( period 1 ) or with loperamide plus quinidine or HM30181 in period 2 or 3 , respectively . In period 3 , subjects randomly received one of three HM30181 doses : 15 , 60 or 180mg . Changes in pupil size , alertness , oxygen saturation and the oral bioavailability of loperamide were assessed in each period . In addition , the pharmacokinetics of HM30181 were determined . Pupil size , alertness and oxygen saturation did not change over time when loperamide alone or loperamide plus HM30181 was administered while HM30181 significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide , i.e. the geometric mean ratio ( 90 % confidence interval ) of AUC ( 0 , tlast ) for loperamide with and without HM30181 was 1.48 ( 1.08 , 2.02 ) . Co-administered quinidine significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide 2.2-fold ( 1.53 , 3.18 ) , which also markedly reduced pupil size , resulting in a decrease of 24.7 mmh in the area under the effect curve of pupil size change from baseline compared with loperamide alone . HM30181 inhibits P-gp mainly in the intestinal endothelium , which can be beneficial because pan-inhibition of P-gp , particularly in the brain , could lead to detrimental adverse events . Further studies are warranted to investigate adequately the dose-exposure relationship of HM30181 , along with its duration of effect .',\n",

       " ' Patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases undergo hepatic resection with curative intent . Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography ( PET-CT ) could help avoid noncurative surgery by identifying patients with occult metastases . To determine the effect of preoperative PET-CT vs no PET-CT ( control ) on the surgical management of patients with resectable metastases and to investigate the effect of PET-CT on survival and the association between the standardized uptake value ( ratio of tissue radioactivity to injected radioactivity adjusted by weight ) and survival . A randomized trial of patients older than 18 years with colorectal cancer treated by surgery , with resectable metastases based on CT scans of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis within the previous 30 days , and with a clear colonoscopy within the previous 18 months was conducted between 2005 and 2013 , involving 21 surgeons at 9 hospitals in Ontario , Canada , with PET-CT scanners at 5 academic institutions . Patients were randomized using a 2 to 1 ratio to PET-CT or control . The primary outcome was a change in surgical management defined as canceled hepatic surgery , more extensive hepatic surgery , or additional organ surgery based on the PET-CT . Survival was a secondary outcome . Of the 263 patients who underwent PET-CT , 21 had a change in surgical management ( 8.0 % ; 95 % CI , 5.0 % -11.9 % ) . Specifically , 7 patients ( 2.7 % ) did not undergo laparotomy , 4 ( 1.5 % ) had more extensive hepatic surgery , 9 ( 3.4 % ) had additional organ surgery ( 8 of whom had hepatic resection ) , and the abdominal cavity was opened in 1 patient but hepatic surgery was not performed and the cavity was closed . Liver resection was performed in 91 % of patients in the PET-CT group and 92 % of the control group . After a median follow-up of 36 months , the estimated mortality rate was 11.13 ( 95 % CI , 8.95-13 .68 ) events/1000 person-months for the PET-CT group and 12.71 ( 95 % CI , 9.40-16 .80 ) events/1000 person-months for the control group . Survival did not differ between the 2 groups ( hazard ratio , 0.86 [ 95 % CI , 0.60-1 .21 ] ; P = .38 ) . The standardized uptake value was associated with survival ( hazard ratio , 1.11 [ 90 % CI , 1.07-1 .15 ] per unit increase ; P < .001 ) . The C statistic for the model including the standardized uptake value was 0.62 ( 95 % CI , 0.56-0 .68 ) and without it was 0.50 ( 95 % CI , 0.44-0 .56 ) . The difference in C statistics is 0.12 ( 95 % CI , 0.04-0 .21 ) . The low C statistic suggests that the standard uptake value is not a strong predictor of overall survival . Among patients with potentially resectable hepatic metastases of colorectal adenocarcinoma , the use of PET-CT compared with CT alone did not result in frequent change in surgical management . These findings raise questions about the value of PET-CT scans in this setting . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00265356 .',\n",
       " ' Intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( r-tPA ) , despite a risk of early symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sICH ) , is of net clinical benefit to acute stroke patients .

We used the Third International Stroke Trial ( IST-3 ) trial data set , an international , multicenter , open treatment randomized trial of 0.9 mg/kg r-tPA versus control in 3035 patients with acute ischemic stroke . We compared the discrimination and calibration of previously developed predictive models for ICH and poststroke poor outcome and developed a new model using variables selected by systematic review . We calculated the absolute and relative risk reduction of death or dependency with r-tPA in patients at a low , medium , or high predicted risk of sICH or poor functional outcome . Prediction models for sICH or poor outcome ( Hemorrhage After Thrombolysis [ HAT ] ; Sugar , Early Infarct Signs , Dense Artery , Age , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Stroke Score ( SEDAN ) ; Glucose Race Age Sex Pressure Stroke Severity [ GRASPS ] ; Stroke Thrombolytic Predictive Instrument ; Dense Artery , Rankin Score , Age , Glucose , Onset to Treatment Time , NIHSS [ DRAGON ] ; Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events [ THRIVE ] ; our new model ; and a model with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and age ) had similar area under receiver operator characteristic curves ( AUROCC ) to predict sICH ( P for difference > 0.05 ) . The simplest model ( with covariates National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and age ) predicted both sICH ( AUROCC , 0.63 ; 95 % CI , 0.58-0 .68 ) and poststroke poor functional outcome ( AUROCC , 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.77-0 .82 ) similarly to complex models . There was no evidence that the effect of r-tPA in patients at high predicted risk of sICH or poor functional outcome after stroke was less than in those at lower risk .

A convenience sample of 17 anesthesia residents and fellows with at least 3 years of anesthesia training was recruited from teaching hospitals in Toronto for a randomized crossover trial . Each participant passed each DLT over an AEC in an airway simulator , visualized and video recorded via a video laryngoscope ( GlideScope ) . The order of exchange was randomized by blindly pulling the name of the manufacturer of a DLT from a box . The primary outcome was time to intubate , defined as time from the bronchial lumen entering the GlideScope view to the bronchial lumen passing the vocal cords . Also recorded were participants ' subjective rating of the ease of use and failure rate , defined as an attempt > 150-second duration . Time to intubate was faster with the Fuji-Phycon DLT ( median 2 seconds ) compared with both the Rusch ( median 27 seconds , P = 0.0144 ) and Mallinckrodt ( median 21 seconds , P = 0.0117 ) . On a scale of 1 to 10 , with 10 being very easy to use and 1 being very difficult , the Fuji-Phycon was judged to be easier to use ( median 10 seconds ) compared with the Rusch ( median 3 , P = 0.0186 ) and the Mallinckrodt ( median 4 seconds , P = 0.0123 ) . The Rusch was associated with significantly more failures than the other DLTs , P = 0.002 . The Fuji-Phycon DLT was easier to pass over an AEC in this simulator trial and warrants consideration in patients with difficult airways who require 1-lung ventilation .\",\n",
       " ' Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) after cardiac surgery procedures is associated with poor patient outcomes . Cystatin C as a marker for renal failure has been shown to be of prognostic value ; however , a wide range of its predictive accuracy has been reported . The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the measurement of pre - and postoperative serum cystatin C improves the prediction of AKI . In a single-centre , prospective study of 70 patients ( 74 9 ys ; range 47-85 ys ; 77 % male ) , cystatin C was measured six times : ( T1 = preoperative , T2 = start cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , T3 = 20 min after CPB , T4 = end of operation ; T5 = 24 h postoperatively ; T6 = 7d postoperatively ) . Predictive property , in terms of the need for renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) , was analysed by receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) statistics and described by the area under the curve ( AUC ) . With respect to RRT ( n = 8 ) , serum cystatin C was significantly higher at the end of the operation ( T4 ) , 24 h postoperatively at T5 and at T6 . The AUCs for preoperative T1 and intraoperative T2/3 cystatin C were < 0.7 ( 95 % CI , 0.47-0 .85 ) . The earliest significant predictive AUCs were found at the end of the operation ( T4 : p = 0.03 95 % CI 0.58-0 .88 AUC 0.73 ) and 24 h postoperatively ( T5 : p = 0.003 95 % CI 0.74-0 .96 AUC 0.85 ) .

In weeks 1 and 12 , the patients underwent three 2-h 15-mM hyperglycaemic clamp experiments with infusion of either saline , GLP-1 or GIP . - cell function was evaluated according to first-phase , second-phase , incremental and total insulin and C-peptide responses . In the sitagliptin group , the mean HbA1c concentration was significantly reduced by 0.9 % ( p = 0.01 ) . The total - cell response during GIP infusion improved significantly from week 1 to week 12 , both within the sitagliptin group ( p = 0.004 ) and when compared with the placebo group ( p = 0.04 ) . The total - cell response during GLP-1 infusion was significantly higher ( p = 0.001 ) when compared with saline and GIP infusion , but with no improvement from week 1 to week 12 . No significant changes in - cell function occurred in the placebo group . Treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin over 12 weeks in patients with T2DM partially restored the lost insulinotropic effect of GIP , whereas the preserved insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 was not further improved . A gradual enhancement of the insulinotropic effect of GIP , therefore , possibly contributes to the antidiabetic actions of DPP-4 inhibitors .',\n",

A CST program based on patient preferences is effective for both oncologists and patients with cancer . Oncologists should consider CST as an approach to enhancing their communication skills .\",\n",
       " ' Attention bias modification treatment ( ABMT ) is a promising novel treatment for anxiety disorders , but clinical trials have focused largely on stand-alone formats among adults . This randomized controlled trial examined the augmenting effects of threat-based ABMT on cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in clinically anxious youth . Sixty-three treatment-seeking children with anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups : ABMT + CBT ; ABMT placebo + CBT ; and CBT-alone . Participants in the 2 ABMT conditions received repeated training on dot-probe tasks either designed to shift attention away from threats ( active ) or designed to induce no changes in attention patterns ( placebo ) . Primary outcome measures were frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms as determined by a clinician using a semi-structured interview . Self - and parent-rated anxiety measures and threat-related attention bias scores were also measured before and after treatment . Both the active and placebo ABMT groups showed greater reductions in clinician-rated anxiety symptoms than the CBT-alone group . Furthermore , only the active ABMT group showed significant reduction in self - or parent-rated anxiety symptoms . Finally , all groups showed a shift in attention patterns across the study , starting with a bias toward threat at baseline and shifting attention away from threat after treatment . Active and placebo ABMT might augment the clinical response to CBT for anxiety . This effect could arise from benefits associated with performing computer-based paradigms such as the dot-probe task . Given the absence of group differences in attention-bias changes during treatment , possible mechanisms and methodological issues underlying the observed findings are discussed .

       " ' Treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are elderly or who have comorbidities is challenging because fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapies are mostly not suitable . Chlorambucil remains the standard of care in many countries . We aimed to investigate whether the addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil could lead to better clinical outcomes than does treatment with chlorambucil alone , while also being tolerable for patients who have few treatment options . We carried out a randomised , open-label , phase 3 trial for treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 109 centres in 16 countries . We included patients who had active disease needing treatment , but in whom fludarabine-based treatment was not possible . We randomly assigned patients ( 1:1 ) to receive oral chlorambucil ( 10 mg/m ( 2 ) ) on days 1-7 of a 28 day treatment course or to receive chlorambucil by this schedule plus intravenous ofatumumab ( cycle 1 : 300 mg on day 1 and 1000 mg on day 8 ; subsequent cycles : 1000 mg on day 1 ) for three to 12 cycles . Assignment was done with a randomisation list that was computer generated at GlaxoSmithKline , and was stratified , in a block size of two , by age , disease stage , and performance status . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and assessment was done by an independent review committee that was masked to group assignment . The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00748189 . We enrolled 447 patients , median age 69 years ( range 35-92 ) . Between Dec 22 , 2008 , and May 26 , 2011 , we randomly assigned 221 patients to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab and 226 patients to chlorambucil alone . Median progression-free survival was 224 months ( 95 % CI 190-252 ) in the group assigned to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab compared with 131 months ( 106-138 ) in the group assigned to chlorambucil only ( hazard ratio 057 , 95 % CI 045-072 ; p < 00001 ) . Grade 3 or greater adverse events were more common in the chlorambucil plus ofatumumab group ( 109 [ 50 % ] patients ; vs 98 [ 43 % ] given chlorambucil alone ) , with neutropenia being the most common event ( 56 [ 26 % ] vs 32 [ 14 % ] ) . Grade 3 or greater infections had similar frequency in both groups . Grade 3 or greater infusion-related adverse events were reported in 22 ( 10 % ) patients given chlorambucil plus ofatumumab . Five ( 2 % ) patients died during treatment in each group . Addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil led to clinically important improvements with a manageable side-effect profile in treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who were elderly or had comorbidities . Chlorambucil plus ofatumumab is therefore an important treatment option for these patients who can not tolerate more intensive therapy . GlaxoSmithKline , Genmab A/S .',\n",
       " ' To compare the efficacy and safety of weekly albiglutide with daily sitagliptin , daily glimepiride , and placebo . Patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin were randomized to albiglutide ( 30 mg ) , sitagliptin ( 100 mg ) , glimepiride ( 2 mg ) , or placebo . Blinded dose titration for albiglutide ( to 50 mg ) and glimepiride ( to 4 mg ) was based on predefined hyperglycemia criteria . The primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline at week 104 . Secondary end points included fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , weight , and time to hyperglycemic rescue . Baseline characteristics were similar among the albiglutide ( n = 302 ) , glimepiride ( n = 307 ) , sitagliptin ( n = 302 ) , and placebo ( n = 101 ) groups . Baseline HbA1c was 8.1 % ( 65.0 mmol/mol ) ; mean age was 54.5 years . The mean doses for albiglutide and glimepiride at week 104 were 40.5 and 3.1 mg , respectively . At week 104 , albiglutide significantly reduced HbA1c compared with placebo ( -0.9 % [ -9.8 mmol/mol ] ; P < 0.0001 ) , sitagliptin ( -0.4 % [ -4.4 mmol/mol ] ; P = 0.0001 ) , and glimepiride ( -0.3 % [ -3.3 mmol/mol ] ; P = 0.0033 ) . Outcomes for FPG and HbA1c were similar . Weight change from baseline for each were as follows : albiglutide -1.21 kg ( 95 % CI -1.68 to -0.74 ) , placebo -1.00 kg ( 95 % CI -1.81 to -0.20 ) , sitagliptin -0.86 kg ( 95 % CI -1.32 to -0.39 ) , glimepiride 1.17 kg ( 95 % CI 0.70-1 .63 ) . The difference between albiglutide and glimepiride was statistically significant ( P < 0.0001 ) . Hyperglycemic rescue rate at week 104 was 25.8 % for albiglutide compared with 59.2 % ( P < 0.0001 ) , 36.4 % ( P = 0.0118 ) , and 32.7 % ( P = 0.1504 ) for placebo , sitagliptin , and glimepiride , respectively . Rates of serious adverse events in the albiglutide group were similar to comparison groups . Diarrhea ( albiglutide 12.9 % , other groups 8.6-10 .9 % ) and nausea ( albiglutide 10.3 % , other groups 6.2-10 .9 % ) were generally the most frequently reported gastrointestinal events . Added to metformin , albiglutide was well tolerated ; produced superior reductions in HbA1c and FPG at week 104 compared with placebo , sitagliptin , and glimepiride ; and resulted in weight loss compared with glimepiride .',\n",
       " ' Despite a favorable clinical experience , little evidence exists for the efficacy of greater occipital nerve block ( GONB ) in migraine treatment . Considering such a premise , we wished to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of GONB in patients affected by migraine headaches . A randomized double-blinded controlled trial was conducted on 48 patients suffering from migraine headaches . A syringe containing 1.0 mL of lidocaine 2 % , 0.5 mL of either saline ( control group , N = 24 ) or triamcinolone 0.5 mL ( intervention group , N = 24 ) was prepared for each patient . Patients were assessed prior to the injection , and also 2 weeks , 1 month , and 2 months thereafter for severity and frequency of pain , times to use analgesics and any appeared side effects . No significant differences were revealed in pain severity , pain frequency , and analgesics use between the two groups at the four study time points including at baseline , and 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after the intervention . However , in both groups , the indices of pain severity , pain frequency , and analgesics use were significantly reduced at the three time points after the intervention compared with before the intervention . GONB with triamcinolone in combination with lidocaine or normal saline with lidocaine results in reducing pain severity and frequency as well as use of analgesics up to two months after the intervention , however any difference attributed to the drug regimens by assessing of the trend of pain characteristics changes .',\n",
       " ' The aim of the article was to investigate the effect of ondansetron preloading with crystalloid infusion after spinal anesthesia during cesarean delivery . A total of 66 parturient women scheduled for elective caesarean sections were randomly assigned to two groups . Five minutes before spinal anesthesia , Group O patients were injected with 4 mg of ondansetron , while Group S patients were injected with 5 mL physiological saline . Maternal blood pressure and heart rate were measured at 2 minute intervals for 30 minutes . After delivery , umbilical cord blood samples were analyzed . Maternal hypotension and nausea were significantly lower in ondansetron-treated patients versus placebo ( p = 0.011 vs. 0.004 ) . Umbilical venous pH was significantly higher in ondansetron-treated patients ( p = 0.006 ) , while partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( Pco 2 ) was significantly lower ( p = 0.002 ) . Decreases in maternal systolic and mean arterial blood pressures were significantly lower in ondansetron-treated patients ( p = 0.008 vs. 0.025 ) , with less requirement for phenylephrine administration compared with controls ( p = 0.029 ) .

       " ' The common bean is a staple crop in many African and Latin American countries and is the focus of biofortification initiatives . Bean iron concentration has been doubled by selective plant breeding , but the additional iron is reported to be of low bioavailability , most likely due to high phytic acid ( PA ) concentrations . The present study evaluated the impact of PA on iron bioavailability from iron-biofortified beans . Iron absorption , based on erythrocyte incorporation of stable iron isotopes , was measured in 22 Rwandese women who consumed multiple , composite bean meals with potatoes or rice in a crossover design . Iron absorption from meals containing biofortified beans ( 8.8 mg Fe , 1320 mg PA/100 g ) and control beans ( 5.4 mg Fe , 980 mg PA/100 g ) was measured with beans containing either their native PA concentration or with beans that were 50 % dephytinized or > 95 % dephytinized . The iron concentration of the cooked composite meals with biofortified beans was 54 % higher than in the same meals with control beans . With native PA concentrations , fractional iron absorption from the control bean meals was 9.2 % , 30 % higher than that from the biofortified bean meals ( P < 0.001 ) . The quantity of iron absorbed from the biofortified bean meals ( 406 g ) was 19 % higher ( P < 0.05 ) than that from the control bean meals . With 50 % and > 95 % dephytinization , the quantity of iron absorbed from the biofortified bean meals increased to 599 and 746 g , respectively , which was 37 % ( P < 0.005 ) and 51 % ( P < 0.0001 ) higher than from the control bean meals . PA strongly decreases iron bioavailability from iron-biofortified beans , and a high PA concentration is an important impediment to the optimal effectiveness of bean iron biofortification . Plant breeders should focus on lowering the PA concentration of high-iron beans . This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01521273 .',\n",
       " \" The exact force systems as well as their progressions generated by removable thermoplastic appliances have not been investigated . Thus , the purposes of this experimental study were to quantify the forces and moments delivered by a single aligner and a series of aligners ( Invisalign ; Align Technology , Santa Clara , Calif ) and to investigate the influence of attachments and power ridges on the force transfer . We studied 970 aligners of the Invisalign system ( 60 series of aligners ) . The aligners came from 30 consecutive patients , of which 3 tooth movements ( incisor torque , premolar derotation , molar distalization ) with 20 movements each were analyzed . The 3 movement groups were subdivided so that 10 movements were supported with an attachment and 10 were not . The patients ' ClinCheck ( Align Technology , Santa Clara , Calif ) was planned so that the movements to be investigated were performed in isolation in the respective quadrant . Resin replicas of the patients ' intraoral situation before the start of the investigated movement were taken and mounted in a biomechanical measurement system . An aligner was put on the model , the force systems were measured , and the calculated movements were experimentally performed until no further forces or moments were generated . Subsequently , the next aligners were installed , and the measurements were repeated . The initial mean moments were about 7.3 Nmm for maxillary incisor torque and about 1.0 N for distalization . Significant differences in the generated moments were measured in the premolar derotation group , whether they were supported with an attachment ( 8.8 Nmm ) or not ( 1.2 Nmm ) . All measurements showed an exponential force change . Apart from a few maximal initial force systems , the forces and moments generated by aligners of the Invisalign system are within the range of orthodontic forces . The force change is exponential while a patient is wearing removable thermoplastic appliances .\",\n",

       " ' Medications for respiratory disorders including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) are typically delivered to the lung by means of a handheld inhaler . Patient preference for and ability to use the inhaler may influence their adherence to maintenance therapy , and adherence may affect treatment outcomes . In this study , patient experience of using a dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) , the ELLIPTA DPI , in clinical trials of a new maintenance therapy for asthma and COPD was investigated . The ELLIPTA DPI has been designed to contain two separate blister strips from which inhalation powder can be delivered , and to be simple to use with a large , easy-to-read dose counter . Semi-structured , in-depth , qualitative interviews were carried out 2-4 weeks after patients had completed one of six phase IIIa clinical trials using the ELLIPTA DPI . Interview participants were asked about their satisfaction with various attributes of the inhaler and their preference for the ELLIPTA DPI relative to currently-prescribed inhalers , and responses were explored using an inductive content analysis approach . Participants also rated the performance of the inhaler on several criteria , using a subjective 1-10 scale . Participants with asthma ( n = 33 ) and COPD ( n = 42 ) reported high levels of satisfaction with the ELLIPTA DPI . It was frequently described as straightforward to operate and easy to use by interview participants . Ergonomic design , mouthpiece fit , and dose counter visibility and ease of interpretation emerged as frequently cited drivers of preference for the ELLIPTA DPI compared with their current prescribed inhaler . Of participants with asthma , 71 % preferred the ELLIPTA DPI to DISKUS and 60 % to metered dose inhalers . Of participants with COPD , 86 % preferred the ELLIPTA DPI to DISKUS , 95 % to HandiHaler , and 85 % to metered dose inhalers . Overall average performance scores were > 9 ( out of 10 ) in participants with asthma and COPD . The ELLIPTA DPI was associated with high patient satisfaction and was preferred to other inhalers by interview participants with asthma and COPD . The development of an inhaler that is regarded as easy and intuitive to use may have positive implications for adherence to therapy in asthma and COPD .',\n",

       " \" Learners can focus on mastery ( i.e. task orientation ) or on learning relative to others ( i.e. ego orientation ) . Previous research suggests task orientations are optimal for learning , a benefit usually linked to the suggestion that qualitative comments are better for learning than quantitative comparisons ( i.e. grades ) . Yet , it is not clear if the observed effects are attributable to the feedback orientation ( i.e. task versus ego ) , feedback format ( i.e. comments versus numerical scores ) , or an interaction between the two . Here , we aimed to clarify the effects of feedback orientation and feedback format during simulation-based training in endotracheal intubation . Forty-one medical students were randomly assigned to four feedback conditions : Task-oriented Numerical ; Ego-oriented Numerical ; Task-oriented Comment , and Ego-oriented Comment . Participants performed a total of 20 trials of endotracheal intubation . Pre-test , post-test and retention test assessments included the use of hand motion analysis and a global rating scale ( GRS ) . Participants rated feedback credibility , self-assessment and self-confidence using Likert-type scales . Analyses of variance were used to examine group differences . Participants ' performance did not differ significantly on the easiest ( p > 0.2 ) or two complex variations of intubation ( p > 0.3 ) . For the moderately difficult variation , analyses of hand motion and GRS data revealed significant group differences at post-test ( p < 0.05 ) , but no differences on the retention test . Analysis of participants ' perceptions showed significant interactions whereby the Ego-oriented Numerical group rated feedback credibility ( p < 0.01 ) higher than the Task-oriented Numerical group ; the two Comment groups did not differ . Some participants recounted negative experiences with the feedback they received . Medical students responded to feedback in ways that challenge previous education research . Specifically , students preferred and improved more in the short term ( but not at retention ) when receiving Ego-oriented feedback in Numerical form . Although learning retention did not differ significantly across feedback conditions , students ' perceptions of themselves and of the teacher and training environment did differ and the implications for trainees ' future learning must be considered .\",\n",

       " ' A retrospective radiographical study . To construct a predictive model for pelvic tilt ( PT ) based on the sacrofemoral-pubic ( SFP ) angle in patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis secondary to ankylosing spondylitis ( or AS ) . PT is a key pelvic parameter in the regulation of spine sagittal alignment that can be used to plan the appropriate osteotomy angle in patients with AS with thoracolumbar kyphosis . However , it could be difficult to measure PT in patients with femoral heads poorly visualized on lateral radiographs . Previous studies showed that the SFP angle could be used to evaluate PT in adult patients with scoliosis . However , this method has not been validated in patients with AS . A total of 115 patients with AS with thoracolumbar kyphosis were included . Full-length anteroposterior and lateral spine radiographs were all available , with spinal and pelvic anatomical landmarks clearly identified . PT , SFP angle , and global kyphosis were measured . The patients were randomly divided into group A ( n = 65 ) and group B ( n = 50 ) . In group A , the predictive model for PT was constructed by the results of the linear regression analysis . In group B , the predictive ability and accuracy of the predictive model were investigated . In group A , the Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the SFP angle and PT ( r = 0.852 ; P < 0.001 ) . The predictive model for PT was constructed as PT = 72.3-0 .82 ( SFP angle ) . In group B , PT was predicted by the model with a mean error of 4.6 ( SD = 4.5 ) with a predictive value of 78 % . PT can be accurately predicted by the SFP angle using the current model : PT = 72.3-0 .82 ( SFP angle ) , when the femur heads are poorly visualized on lateral radiographs in patients with AS with thoracolumbar kyphosis . 4 .',\n",
       " ' In type 2 diabetes , acute hyperglycemia worsens endothelial function and inflammation , while resistance to GLP-1 action occurs . All these phenomena seem to be related to the generation of oxidative stress . A Mediterranean diet , supplemented with olive oil , increases plasma antioxidant capacity , suggesting that its implementation can have a favorable effect on the aforementioned phenomena . In the present study , we test the hypothesis that a Mediterranean diet using olive oil can counteract the effects of acute hyperglycemia and can improve the resistance of the endothelium to GLP-1 action . Two groups of type 2 diabetic patients , each consisting of twelve subjects , participated in a randomized trial for three months , following a Mediterranean diet using olive oil or a control low-fat diet . Plasma antioxidant capacity , endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , 8-iso-PGF2a , IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study . The effect of GLP-1 during a hyperglycemic clamp , was also studied at baseline and at the end of the study . Compared to the control diet , the Mediterranean diet increased plasma antioxidant capacity and improved basal endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , 8-iso-PGF2a , IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels . The Mediterranean diet also reduced the negative effects of acute hyperglycemia , induced by a hyperglycemic clamp , on endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , 8-iso-PGF2a , IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels . Furthermore , the Mediterranean diet improved the protective action of GLP-1 on endothelial function , nitrotyrosine , 8-iso-PGF2a , IL-6 and ICAM-1 levels , also increasing GLP-1-induced insulin secretion . These data suggest that the Mediterranean diet , using olive oil , prevents the acute hyperglycemia effect on endothelial function , inflammation and oxidative stress , and improves the action of GLP-1 , which may have a favorable effect on the management of type 2 diabetes , particularly for the prevention of cardiovascular disease .',\n",
       " ' To investigate the effect of a 9-month physical activity intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness and adiposity among prepubertal children . Prepubertal children ( 8 - to 9-year-olds , N = 220 , 103 girls ) were randomly assigned to a 9-month physical activity intervention or a control group . The intervention provided 70 minutes ( 5 days/week ) of moderate to vigorous physical activity . Maximum oxygen consumption ( Vo2max percentile ) and dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry measured cardiorespiratory fitness and adiposity , respectively . Intention-to-treat analysis was performed to assess baseline and follow-up cardiorespiratory fitness , percentage fat mass ( % FM ) , percentage central fat mass ( % CFM ) , and estimated visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) area . The intervention group increased in cardiorespiratory fitness ( 5.4 th percentile ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.8 to 8.9 ) and decreased in % FM ( -0.7 % ; 95 % CI , -1.1 to -0.4 ) and % CFM ( -1.3 % ; 95 % CI , -1.9 to -0.7 ) . Reductions in % FM were evident for both nonoverweight ( -0.62 % ; 95 % CI , -1.07 to -0.17 ) and overweight or obese ( -0.86 % ; 95 % CI,-1 .46 to -0.25 ) intervention participants . Conversely , the control group displayed no change in cardiorespiratory fitness while exhibiting increases in % FM ( 0.4 % ; 95 % CI , 0.1 to 0.7 ) , % CFM ( 0.6 ; 95 % CI , 0.1 to 1.1 ) , and VAT area ( 3.0 cm ( 2 ) ; 95 % CI , 1.6 to 4.4 ) . Nonoverweight control participants increased in % FM ( 0.52 % ; 95 % CI , 0.13 to 0.91 ) , and their overweight and obese counterparts increased in VAT ( 4.76 cm ( 2 ) ; 95 % CI , 1.90 to 7.63 ) . The physical activity intervention improved cardiorespiratory fitness , reduced % FM , and prevented accumulation of % CFM among prepubertal children with varying adiposity levels . These findings provide support for daily physical activity recommendations to prevent excess fat mass accumulation in childhood .',\n",
       " ' Applying a direct renin inhibitor ( DRI ) to advanced stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patients is a matter of controversy . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the DRI , aliskiren , in patients with therapy-resistant hypertension undergoing hemodialysis ( HD ) . The study was a prospective , randomized multicenter trial exploring the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren in comparison with amlodipine , a calcium channel blocker , in patients undergoing HD . A total of 83 participants whose blood pressure ( BP ) had previously been treated with more than one antihypertensive agent and not having achieved the BP goal of < 140/90 mmHg were randomly assigned to either aliskiren 150 mg or amlodipine 5 mg as an add-on therapy . A significant decrease in pre-dialysis clinic BP and home BP was found only in the amlodipine group and not in the aliskiren group . In contrast , there was a significant decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) in the aliskiren group but not in the amlodipine group . N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic hormone remained unchanged in both groups . Aliskiren significantly reduced angiotensin I and II , plasma renin activity , and increased plasma renin content . However , such changes were not observed in the amlodipine group . Amlodipine , not aliskiren , effectively reduces BP in CKD patients with refractory hypertension undergoing HD . Aliskiren suppresses the renin-angiotensin system and reduces ANP . Whether the DRI is beneficial in improving cardiovascular events in patients undergoing HD remains to be elucidated in future studies .',\n",

       " \" One of the advantages of Internet-based research is the ability to efficiently recruit large , diverse samples of international participants . Currently , there is a dearth of information on the behind-the-scenes process to setting up successful online recruitment tools . The objective of the study was to examine the comparative impact of Spanish - and English-language keywords for a Google AdWords campaign to recruit pregnant women to an Internet intervention and to describe the characteristics of those who enrolled in the trial . Spanish - and English-language Google AdWords campaigns were created to advertise and recruit pregnant women to a Web-based randomized controlled trial for the prevention of postpartum depression , the Mothers and Babies/Mams y Bebs Internet Project . Search engine users who clicked on the ads in response to keyword queries ( eg , pregnancy , depression and pregnancy ) were directed to the fully automated study website . Data on the performance of keywords associated with each Google ad reflect Web user queries from February 2009 to June 2012 . Demographic information , self-reported depression symptom scores , major depressive episode status , and Internet use data were collected from enrolled participants before randomization in the intervention study . The Google ads received high exposure ( 12,983,196 impressions ) and interest ( 176,295 clicks ) from a global sample of Web users ; 6745 pregnant women consented to participate and 2575 completed enrollment in the intervention study . Keywords that were descriptive of pregnancy and distress or pregnancy and health resulted in higher consent and enrollment rates ( i.e. , high-performing ads ) . In both languages , broad keywords ( eg , pregnancy ) had the highest exposure , more consented participants , and greatest cost per consent ( up to US $ 25.77 per consent ) . The online ads recruited a predominantly Spanish-speaking sample from Latin America of Mestizo racial identity . The English-speaking sample was also diverse with most participants residing in regions of Asia and Africa . Spanish-speaking participants were significantly more likely to be of Latino ethnic background , not married , completed fewer years of formal education , and were more likely to have accessed the Internet for depression information ( P < .001 ) . The Internet is an effective method for reaching an international sample of pregnant women interested in online interventions to manage changes in their mood during the perinatal period . To increase efficiency , Internet advertisements need to be monitored and tailored to reflect the target population 's conceptualization of health issues being studied .

Patients with burns 70 % or greater of their total body surface area were included , and their plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and clinical outcomes were compared . A total of 69 patients were included in this study , with 31 patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment and the others not . Patient demographics including age , burn size , and incidence of inhalation injury were similar in both groups . The incidence of pulmonary infection and stress ulcer ( and/or hemorrhage ) was 24.2 % and 3.0 % in the treatment group , respectively , significantly lower than 47.8 % and 19.6 % of the control group ( P < .05 ) . Length of hospital stay was almost 13 days shorter in the treatment group ( P < .05 ) , whereas there was no significant difference in the overall mortality , duration of mechanical ventilation , and incidence of sepsis between the 2 groups . The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results confirmed that the plasma levels of C-reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor - , interleukin-6 , and interleukin-8 were significantly lower in the treatment group ( P < .05 ) . Low dose of glucocorticoid treatment during the acute phase could reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in severely burned patients and subsequently decrease the incidence of pulmonary infection and stress ulcer , as well as the length of hospital stay .',\n",

Sixty patients scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups to receive either bupivacaine 10 mg combined with 0.1 mg/kg ketamine , or bupivacaine 10 mg combined with 0.5 mL distilled water intrathecally . The time to the first analgesic request , analgesic requirement in the first 24 hours after surgery , onset times of sensory and motor blockades , the durations of sensory and motor blockades , and the incidences of adverse effects such as hypotension , ephedrine requirement , bradycardia , and hypoxemia , were recorded . Patients who received ketamine had a significantly prolonged duration of anesthesia compared with those who did not in the control group [ 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) 195-217 ; p = 0.001 ] . The mean time to the first analgesic request was also significantly longer in ketamine group ( 95 % CI 252.5-275 ; p < 0.001 ) .

Randomized controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of topical TXA compared with placebo , but the comparison between topical and intravenous TXA is unclear . The present study was designed to verify noninferior efficacy and safety of topical intra-articular TXA compared with intravenous TXA in primary total knee replacement with cemented implants . A Phase-III , single-center , double-blind , randomized , controlled clinical trial was performed to compare topical intra-articular TXA ( 3 g of TXA in 100 mL of physiological saline solution ) with two intravenous doses of TXA ( 15 mg/kg in 100 mL of physiological saline solution , one dose before tourniquet release and another three hours after surgery ) in a multimodal protocol for blood loss prevention . The primary outcome was the blood transfusion rate , and the secondary outcomes included visible blood loss ( as measured in the drain ) at twenty-four hours postoperatively and invisible blood loss ( as estimated from the Nadler formula ) at forty-eight hours postoperatively . The sample size of seventy-eight patients was calculated to give a statistical power of 99 % for demonstrating noninferiority . Thirty-nine patients each were allocated to receive topical intra-articular TXA ( the experimental group ) and intravenous TXA ( the control group ) ; there were no significant differences in demographics or preoperative laboratory values between the groups . Noninferiority was estimated by comparing the confidence intervals with a delta of 10 % . Student t and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess the significance of any differences . The transfusion rate was zero in both groups ; thus , noninferiority was demonstrated for the primary efficacy end point , suggesting equivalence . Noninferiority was also demonstrated for the secondary efficacy end points . Drain blood loss at twenty-four hours was 315.6 mL ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 248.5 to 382.7 mL ) in the experimental group and 308.1 mL ( 95 % CI , 247.6 to 368.5 mL ) in the control group ( p = 0.948 , Mann-Whitney ) . Also , estimated blood loss at forty-eight hours was 1259.0 mL ( 95 % CI , 1115.6 to 1402.3 mL ) in the experimental group and 1317.9 mL ( 95 % CI , 1175.4 to 1460.4 mL ) in the control group ( p = 0.837 , Mann-Whitney ) . No significant safety differences were seen between groups . Topical administration of TXA according to the described protocol demonstrated noninferiority compared with intravenous TXA , with no safety concerns .

       " \" The standardized patient approach has proved to be an effective training tool for medical educators . This article explains the process of employing standardized patients in an HIV stigma reduction intervention in healthcare settings in China . The study was conducted in 40 hospitals in two provinces of China . One year after the stigma reduction intervention , standardized patients made unannounced visits to participating hospitals , randomly approached service providers on duty and presented symptoms related to HIV and disclosed HIV-positive test results . After each visit , the standardized patients evaluated their providers ' attitudes and behaviours using a structured checklist . Standardized patients also took open-ended observation notes about their experience and the evaluation process . Seven standardized patients conducted a total of 217 assessments ( 108 from 20 hospitals in the intervention condition ; 109 from 20 hospitals in the control condition ) . Based on a comparative analysis , the intervention hospitals received a better rating than the control hospitals in terms of general impression and universal precaution compliance as well as a lower score on stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours toward the standardized patients . Standardized patients are a useful supplement to traditional self-report assessments , particularly for measuring intervention outcomes that are sensitive or prone to social desirability .\",\n",
       " ' Anecdotal reports have demonstrated the feasibility of needle aspiration to deflate a distended bowel , but we do not know of any prospective study that has evaluated this technique . We designed a controlled study to evaluate the use of the selective transperitoneal needle aspiration of a bowel loop ( STAB ) in infants . Candidates were patients of less than 6 months of age , scheduled for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication , in whom severe colonic distension was observed . We randomized the patients to the study drug or placebo in a 1:1 mode . The treatment group received STAB , whereas the control group was subject to conventional maneuvers . We performed 403 Nissen procedures laparoscopically : 102 were in infants 6 months old , but only 44 presented severe transverse colonic distension . STAB facilitated the surgical procedure and drastically reduced surgical time . Thus , we calculated our sample size with use of the following inputs : 90 % power , a critical P value of .05 , and 50 % reduction in surgical time . This resulted in a necessary sample size of 21 subjects per group , for a total required sample size of 42 subjects . STAB procedures were done in 23 patients , and conventional measures were used in 21 . STAB was attempted a total of 45 times . Mean operative time was shorter in the STAB group . We propose the use of STAB as alternative therapy to decompress a dilated large-bowel loop during laparoscopic surgery . This maneuver is simple and efficient and has no clinical complications . Future studies are required to evaluate its role in the subset of other patients or procedures .',\n",
       " \" The traditional oxygen delivery methods for oxygen therapy are continuous flow oxygen ( CFO ) and demand oxygen delivery ( DOD ) ; however , oxygen waste is considerable in CFO , while DOD is uncomfortable for patients . Synchronized DOD ( SDOD ) , which was designed to overcome the drawbacks of both CFO and DOD , supplies oxygen according to the patient 's breathing pattern and the desired oxygen saving . This study was conducted to examine the overall performance of SDOD in terms of oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , patients ' comfort , and oxygen saving ratio ( SR ) . Study subjects were patients who required oxygen for COPD or pneumonia . Patients received oxygen through nasal prongs by CFO and SDOD for 30 min each . SpO2 was measured every 10 min by pulse oximetry , and subjects recorded their level of comfort after 30 min . The flow of discharged oxygen was recorded to calculate SR. . Ten subjects ( median age , 68 y ; range , 56-86 y ) were enrolled . The SpO2 of patients during SDOD ( 97 2 % ) was similar to that during CFO ( 96 3 % ) with no statistically significant difference ( P = .53 ) . Subjects reported SDOD to be more comfortable than CFO . The comfort score of subjects treated with SDOD was 7.05 2.07 ( 0 : very uncomfortable , 10 : very comfortable ) ; this was significantly higher ( P = .02 ) than the comfort score ( 5.20 1.83 ) of subjects treated with CFO . The SR values set by clinicians were very similar to calculated SR values . SDOD appears to be more suitable for oxygen therapy than CFO when considering SpO2 , patients ' comfort , and SR. .\",\n",

Intravenous or SC saline was administered to maintain masking . Efficacy was assessed on day 57 ( 2-4 weeks after last dose ) . Percentage of patients with treatment response , defined as ( 1 ) at least a 2-grade reduction in vitreous haze score or trace or absent vitreous haze in the study eye without an increase in corticosteroid dose and without uveitis worsening or ( 2 ) reduction in corticosteroid dosages to prespecified levels without uveitis worsening . Percentage of patients with remission , defined as anterior chamber cell and vitreous haze scores of 0 or 0.5 + in both eyes without corticosteroid therapy or uveitis worsening . Secukinumab 30 mg/kg IV and 10 mg/kg IV , compared with the 300 mg SC dose , produced higher responder rates ( 72.7 % and 61.5 % vs. 33.3 % , respectively ) and remission rates ( 27.3 % and 38.5 % vs. 16.7 % , respectively ) . Statistical and clinical superiority for the 30 mg/kg IV dose compared with the 300 mg SC dose was established in a Bayesian probability model . Other measures , including time to response onset , change in visual acuity , and change in vitreous haze score , showed numeric trends favoring IV dosing . Secukinumab , administered in IV or SC formulations , appeared safe and was well tolerated . Intravenous secukinumab was effective and well tolerated in noninfectious uveitis requiring systemic corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy . Greater activity with IV dosing suggests that patients may not receive sufficient drug with SC administration .

       " ' Visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . Recent studies have suggested that VAT negatively affects bone . However , MetS has also been associated with higher estradiol ( E2 ) levels , which is bone protective . We therefore investigated the impact of VAT and E2 levels on bone density , structural parameters , and strength estimates . A cross-sectional study was conducted in 72 obese men with MetS to investigate the impact of VAT and E2 levels on bone . Bone parameters were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , quantitative computed tomography ( QCT ) , and high-resolution peripheral QCT ( HRpQCT ) at lumbar spine , proximal femur , radius , and tibia . VAT volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and sexual hormones were measured in blood samples . Men with high VAT had a lower bone density at the hip ( P < 0.05 ) , lower cortical thickness , and higher buckling ratio at femoral neck ( FN ) ( P = 0.008 and P = 0.02 ) , compared with men with low VAT , despite a similar body weight and BMI . Generally , E2 levels were low ( median 43pmol/l ) , and men with E2 levels below median had reduced bone density at lumbar spine ( P = 0.04 ) , and impaired structural parameters at radius and tibia , compared with men with E2 levels above median . At the hip , VAT volume and E2 levels affected bone density independently and additively , and 50 % of men with high VAT and low E2 levels had osteopenia with significantly lower T-score at FN ( P = 0.004 ) . High VAT and low E2 negatively affect bone in obese men with MetS . VAT and E2 affect bone density at the hip independently and additively , revealing an unexpected high prevalence of osteopenia in middle-aged men with MetS .',\n",

       " ' The objectives of the study were to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ( SAFIRE ) for detecting hepatic metastasis and to estimate the potential radiation dose reduction at abdominal computed tomography ( CT ) . Fifty-nine consecutive patients ( mean age , 59.2 years ; range , 42-81 years ) who had hepatic metastasis and who underwent dual-source abdominal CT were enrolled in this study . The image noise of the liver was compared between full-dose filtered back projection images ( FD-FBP ) and simulated half-dose images , which used only single-source projection data , and reconstructed with different strengths of SAFIRE ( HD-SAFIRE ( 1-5 ) ) by 1-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction . The diagnostic performance for hepatic metastasis was compared by logistic regression with the weighted least squares method and noninferiority test between the FD-FBP images and the half-dose sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction ( HD-SAFIRE ) images . As the SAFIRE strength increased , image noise decreased ( P < 0.001 ) . The images of HD-SAFIRE ( 2 ) showed similar image noise for liver parenchyma ( 13.4 Hounsfield unit [ HU ] ) , signal-to-noise ratio for liver parenchyma ( 9.2 ) , and lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio ( 4.5 ) , compared with the FD-FBP images ( 12.6 HU , P = 0.668 ; 9.6 , P > 0.999 ; and 4.5 , P > 0.999 , respectively ) . The diagnostic accuracy for hepatic metastasis with the HD-SAFIRE ( 2 ) images ( 87.5 % ) was not different from that of the FD-FBP images ( 87.5 % , P > 0.999 ) . The diagnostic performance of the HD-SAFIRE ( 2 ) images was also noninferior to that of the FD-FBP images ( 95 % confidence interval lower limit difference [ -9.16 % ] excluding the -10 % clinical noninferiority limit ) . The mean ( SD ) volume CT dose index of FD-FBP was 11.26 ( 2.66 ) mGy , and the mean ( SD ) radiation dose equivalent associated with HD-SAFIRE was estimated to be 5.63 ( 1.33 ) mGy . By applying SAFIRE2 , the radiation dose could be reduced by up to 50 % compared with the standard-of-care abdominal CT protocol without increasing image noise and without deteriorating diagnostic performance for the detection of hepatic metastasis .',\n",

       " \" Oxidative stress and inflammation are two key mechanisms suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Omega-3 fatty acids ( -3 FAs ) found in fish and fish oil have several biological properties that may be beneficial in AD . However , they may also auto-oxidize and induce in vivo lipid peroxidation . The objective of this study was to evaluate systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers following oral supplementation of dietary -3 FA . Forty patients with moderate AD were randomized to receive 1.7 g DHA ( 22:6 ) and 0.6 g EPA ( 20:5 ) or placebo for 6 months . Urinary samples were collected before and after supplementation . The levels of the major F2-isoprostane , 8-iso-PGF2 , a consistent in vivo biomarker of oxidative stress , and 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2 , a major metabolite of PGF2 and biomarker of inflammatory response , were measured . F2-isoprostane in urine increased in the placebo group after 6 months , but there was no clear difference in treatment effect between supplemented and non-supplemented patients on the urinary levels of F2-isoprostanes and 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2 . At baseline , the levels of 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2 showed negative correlative relationships to -3 FAs , and a positive correlation to linoleic acid . 8-iso-PGF2 correlated negatively to the -6 FA arachidonic acid . The findings indicate that supplementation of -3 FAs to patients with AD for 6 months does not have a clear effect on free radical-mediated formation of F2-isoprostane or cyclooxygenase-mediated formation of prostaglandin F2 . The correlative relationships to FAs indicate a potential role of FAs in immunoregulation .\",\n",

The aim of this study was to determine if an EHR alert-at emergency department ( ED ) triage-increases the ED triage nurse 's utilization of triage protocols . ED triage nurses were randomized to receive either a passive EHR alert or no intervention for patients with the following complaints : minor trauma with extremity injuries or female patients with abdominal pain . The EHR alert notified the nurse that the patient was eligible for diagnostic testing : radiographs for patients with injured extremities or urinalysis for female patients with abdominal pain . Twenty-eight nurses triaged 20,410 patients in the 6 months before the intervention and 19,157 in the 6 months after the intervention . Before the intervention , the urinalysis protocol was implemented in 101/624 ( 16.2 % ) patients triaged by the intervention group and 116/711 ( 16.3 % ) triaged by the control group . After the intervention , the urinalysis protocol was implemented in 146/530 ( 27.6 % ) patients triaged by the intervention group and 174/679 ( 25.6 % ) triaged by the control group . Before the intervention , the radiograph protocol was implemented in 58/774 ( 7.5 % ) patients triaged by the intervention group and 45/684 ( 6.6 % ) triaged by the control group . After the intervention , the radiograph protocol was implemented in 78/614 ( 12.7 % ) patients triaged by the intervention group and 79/609 ( 13.0 % ) triaged by the control group . The use of a passive EHR alert to promote ED triage protocols showed little benefit . Before the widespread implementation of EHR alerts for patient care , rigorous studies are required to determine the best alert methods and the impacts of such interventions .\",\n",
       " ' Hemolysis reaction is a rare class effect of therapy with intravenously administered human normal immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . Anti-A/B isoagglutinins ( isohemagglutinins ) originating from donor plasma are considered a probable risk factor for hemolysis . We hypothesized that screening and exclusion of plasma obtained from donors with high isoagglutinin titers from the manufacturing process would produce a meaningful reduction of anti-A/B isoagglutinin titers of the final IVIG product . A donor screening method for anti-A isoagglutinins using an automated indirect agglutination test ( IAT ) in gel cards was developed . Industry-scale donor plasma pools and final IVIG product were prepared according to the manufacturing process of Privigen ( human 10 % liquid IVIG ) . Anti-A/B isoagglutinin levels were measured by IAT , direct agglutination test , and a flow cytometry-based assay . Screening of plasma from 705 randomly selected donors identified 6.8 % donors with high anti-A isoagglutinin titers in plasma . Exclusion of plasma from these donors resulted in a one-titer-step reduction of anti-A isoagglutinin in laboratory-scale pooled plasma . The same donor screening method applied to industry-scale production resulted in exclusion of 5.1 % of donors and produced a one-titer-step reduction of both anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin titers in the final IVIG product . Anti-A/B isoagglutinin titers in IVIG products can be reduced on an industrial scale through implementation of anti-A donor screening , which may lower the risk of hemolysis after IVIG therapy .',\n",
       " ' Rectus sheath block can provide analgesia following umbilical hernia repair . However , conflicting reports on its analgesic effectiveness exist . No study has investigated plasma local anesthetic concentration following ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block ( USGRSB ) in children . Compare the effectiveness and bupivacaine absorption following USGRSB or wound infiltration ( WI ) for umbilical hernia repair in children . A randomized blinded study comparing WI with USGRSB in 40 children undergoing umbilical hernia repair was performed . Group WI ( n = 20 ) received wound infiltration 1 mgkg ( -1 ) 0.25 % bupivacaine . Group RS ( n = 20 ) received USGRSB 0.5 mgkg ( -1 ) 0.25 % bupivacaine per side in the posterior rectus sheath compartment . Pain scores and rescue analgesia were recorded . Blood samples were drawn at 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , and 60 min . Patients in the WI group had a twofold increased risk of requiring morphine ( hazard ratio 2.06 , 95 % CI 1.01 , 4.20 , P = 0.05 ) . When required , median time to first morphine dose was longer in the USGRSB group ( 65.5 min vs. 47.5 min , P = 0.049 ) . Peak plasma bupivacaine concentration was higher following USGRSB than WI ( median : 631.9 ngml ( -1 ) IQR : 553.9-784 .1 vs. 389.7 ngml ( -1 ) IQR : 250.5-502 .7 , P = 0.002 ) . Tmax was longer in the USGRSB group ( median 45 min IQR : 30-60 vs. 20 min IQR : 20-45 , P = 0.006 ) . USGRSB provides more effective analgesia than WI for umbilical hernia repair . USGRSB with 1 mgkg ( -1 ) 0.25 % bupivacaine is associated with safe plasma bupivacaine concentration that peaks higher and later than WI . Caution against using larger volumes of higher concentration local anesthetic for USGRSB is advised .',\n",
       " \" Drug-drug interactions between canagliflozin , a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the management of type-2 diabetes mellitus , and an oral contraceptive ( OC ) , warfarin , and digoxin were evaluated in three phase 1 studies in healthy participants . All studies were open-label ; study 1 included a fixed-sequence design , and studies 2 and 3 used a crossover design . Regimens were : study 1 : OC ( levonorgestrel ( 150 g ) + ethinyl estradiol ( 30 g ) ) / day ( day 1 ) , canagliflozin 200 mg/day ( days 4 - 8 ) , and canagliflozin with OC ( day 9 ) ; study 2 : canagliflozin 300 mg/day ( days 1 - 12 ) with warfarin 30 mg/day ( day 6 ) in period 1 , and only warfarin 30 mg/day ( day 1 ) in period 2 , or vice versa ; study 3 : digoxin alone ( 0.5 mg/day ( day 1 ) + 0.25 mg/day ( days 2 - 7 ) ) in period 1 , and with canagliflozin 300 mg/day ( days 1 - 7 ) in period 2 , or vice versa . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) were assessed at prespecified intervals ; OC : days 1 and 9 , canagliflozin : days 8 - 9 ( study 1 ) ; warfarin : days 6 ( period 1 ) and 1 ( period 2 ) ( study 2 ) ; and digoxin : days 5 - 7 ( periods 1 and 2 ) ( study 3 ) . Warfarin 's pharmacodynamics ( PD ; International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ) was assessed on days 6 ( period 1 ) and 1 ( period 2 ) . Canagliflozin increased the plasma exposure of OC ( maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) : 22 % , area under the curve ( AUC ) : 6 % ) and digoxin ( Cmax : 36 % , AUC : 20 % ) ; but did not alter warfarin 's PK and PD . No clinically relevant safety findings ( including hypoglycemia ) were noted . Canagliflozin can be coadministered with OC , warfarin , or digoxin without dose adjustments .

       " ' This study aimed to determine during 36 months of follow-up the ( 1 ) clinical outcomes and ( 2 ) influence of high-risk human papillomavirus ( HPV ) status on the risk of progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 + ( CIN 2 + ) , among women with histologically proven CIN 1 . This is an ad hoc analysis of women with CIN 1 within TOMBOLA , a randomized trial of the management of women with low-grade cervical cytology . Women from the colposcopy arm with CIN 1 confirmed on punch biopsies and managed conservatively by cytology every 6 months in primary care were included . Sociodemographic data and a sample for HPV testing were collected at recruitment . Data on the sample women were extracted to calculate the cumulative incidence of CIN 2 + and the performance characteristics of the baseline HPV test . Detection of CIN 2 or worse ( CIN 2 + ) during follow-up or at exit colposcopy was analyzed . A total of 171 women were included . Their median age was 29 years . Fifty-two percent were high-risk HPV positive , 17 % were HPV-16 positive , and 11 % were HPV-18 positive . Overall , 21 women ( 12 % ) developed CIN 2 + , with a median time to detection of 25 months . Factors associated with progression to CIN 2 + were presence of HPV-18 ( relative risk = 3.04 ; 95 % CI = 1.09-8 .44 ) and HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at recruitment ( relative risk = 3.98 ; 95 % CI = 1.60-9 .90 ) . The sensitivity and specificity of a combined HPV-16 / HPV-18 test for the detection of CIN 2 + during 3 years were 58 % and 78 % , respectively . Our results suggest that women with confirmed CIN 1 have low rates of progression to high-grade CIN within 3 years . Because the median time to progression was 25 months , conservative management could recommend the next repeat cytology at 2 years .',\n",
       " ' To determine longitudinal changes in angle configuration in the eyes of primary angle-closure suspects ( PACS ) treated by laser peripheral iridotomy ( LPI ) and in untreated fellow eyes . Longitudinal cohort study . Primary angle-closure suspects aged 50 to 70 years were enrolled in a randomized , controlled clinical trial . Each participant was treated by LPI in 1 randomly selected eye , with the fellow eye serving as a control . Angle width was assessed in a masked fashion using gonioscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( AS-OCT ) before and at 2 weeks , 6 months , and 18 months after LPI . Angle width in degrees was calculated from Shaffer grades assessed under static gonioscopy . Angle configuration was also evaluated using angle opening distance ( AOD250 , AOD500 , AOD750 ) , trabecular-iris space area ( TISA500 , TISA750 ) , and angle recess area ( ARA ) measured in AS-OCT images . No significant difference was found in baseline measures of angle configuration between treated and untreated eyes . At 2 weeks after LPI , the drainage angle on gonioscopy widened from a mean of 13.5 at baseline to a mean of 25.7 in treated eyes , which was also confirmed by significant increases in all AS-OCT angle width measures ( P < 0.001 for all variables ) . Between 2 weeks and 18 months after LPI , a significant decrease in angle width was observed over time in treated eyes ( P < 0.001 for all variables ) , although the change over the first 5.5 months was not statistically significant for angle width measured under gonioscopy ( P = 0.18 ) , AOD250 ( P = 0.167 ) and ARA ( P = 0.83 ) . In untreated eyes , angle width consistently decreased across all follow-up visits after LPI , with a more rapid longitudinal decrease compared with treated eyes ( P values for all variables 0.003 ) . The annual rate of change in angle width was equivalent to 1.2 / year ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.8-1 .6 ) in treated eyes and 1.6 / year ( 95 % CI , 1.3-2 .0 ) in untreated eyes ( P < 0.001 ) . Angle width of treated eyes increased markedly after LPI , remained stable for 6 months , and then decreased significantly by 18 months after LPI . Untreated eyes experienced a more consistent and rapid decrease in angle width over the same time period .',\n",
       " \" Chronic pain and progressive loss of physical function with AS may adversely affect health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) . The objective of this study was to assess the 5-year data regarding spinal mobility , physical function and HRQoL in patients with AS who participated in the Adalimumab Trial Evaluating Long-term Efficacy and Safety for AS ( ATLAS ) study . Patients received blinded adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week for 24 weeks , then open-label adalimumab for up to 5 years . Spinal mobility was evaluated using linear BASMI ( BASMIlin ) . BASDAI , total back pain , CRP , BASFI , Short Form-36 and AS quality of life ( ASQoL ) were also assessed . Correlations between BASMIlin and clinical , functional and ASQoL outcomes after 12 weeks and after 5years of adalimumab exposure were evaluated using Spearman 's rank correlation . Associations were further analysed using multivariate regression . Three hundred and eleven patients received 1 dose of adalimumab ; 125 of the 208 patients originally randomized to adalimumab received treatment for 5 years . Improvements in BASMIlin were sustained through 5 years , with a mean change of -0.6 from baseline in the population who completed 5 years of treatment with adalimumab . Improvements in disease activity , physical function and ASQoL were also sustained through 5 years . BASMIlin was significantly correlated with all evaluated clinical outcomes ( P < 0.001 ) . The highest correlation was with BASFI at 12 weeks ( r = 0.52 ) and at 5 years ( r = 0.65 ) . Multivariate regression analysis confirmed this association ( P < 0.001 ) . Treatment with adalimumab for up to 5 years demonstrated sustained benefits in spinal mobility , disease activity , physical function and HRQoL in patients with active AS . Spinal mobility was significantly associated with short - and long-term physical function in these patients . Clinicaltrials.gov ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/NCT00085644 .\",\n",
       " ' The intragastric balloon has been reported to be a safe and effective tool for temporary weight loss . The aim of this study is the evaluation of the possible predictive role of intragastric balloon when used before laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding . A longitudinal multicenter study was conducted in patients with body mass index ( BMI ) > 35 kg/m ( 2 ) who underwent gastric banding with the BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon ( BIB ) . After balloon removal ( 6 mo ) , patients were allocated into 2 group according to their percentage of excess weight loss ( % EWL ) : group > 25 ( % EWL > 25 % ) and group < 25 ( % EWL < 25 % ) . Patients from both group underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) 1-3 months after BIB removal . The LAP-BAND AP band was placed in all patients via pars flaccida . Weight loss parameters were considered in both groups . From January 2005 to December 2009 , 1357 patients were enrolled in this study . Mean BMI at time of BIB positioning was 44.98.4 ( range 29-82 .5 ) . After 6 months , at time of removal , mean BMI was 39.47.3 . According to the cutoff , patients were allocated into group A ( n = 699 ) and group B ( n = 658 ) . At this time the mean BMI was 36.46.4 and 42.76.9 ( P = .001 ) in groups A and B , respectively . At 1-year follow-up from LAGB , mean BMI was 35.86.5 and 40.07.4 ( P < .001 ) in groups A and B , respectively . This significant difference was confirmed at 3 - and 5-year follow-ups . A similar pattern was observed with the % EWL . Satisfactory results with BIB are predictive of a positive outcome of LASB at 1 , 3 , and 5 years after the procedure , and poor results do not inevitably indicate a negative outcome for gastric banding .',\n",
       " ' Calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) is crucial in the pathophysiology of migraine . We assessed the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of ALD403 , a genetically engineered humanised anti-CGRP antibody , for migraine prevention . In this randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , exploratory , proof-of-concept phase 2 trial , patients aged 18-55 years with five to 14 migraine days per 28-day period were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) via an interactive web response system to receive an intravenous dose of ALD403 1000 mg or placebo . Site investigators , patients , and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation during the study . The primary objective was to assess safety at 12 weeks after infusion . The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to weeks 5-8 in the frequency of migraine days , as recorded in patient electronic diaries . Patients were followed up until 24 weeks for exploratory safety and efficacy analyses . Safety and efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01772524 . Between Jan 28 , 2013 , and Dec 23 , 2013 , of 174 patients randomly assigned at 26 centres in the USA , 163 received either ALD403 ( n = 81 ) or placebo ( n = 82 ) . Adverse events were experienced by 46 ( 57 % ) of 81 patients in the ALD403 group and 43 ( 52 % ) of 82 in the placebo group . The most frequent adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection ( placebo 6 [ 7 % ] patients vs ALD403 7 [ 9 % ] patients ) , urinary tract infection ( 4 [ 5 % ] vs 1 [ 1 % ] ) , fatigue ( 3 [ 4 % ] vs 3 [ 4 % ] ) , back pain ( 4 [ 5 % ] vs 3 [ 4 % ] ) , arthralgia ( 4 [ 5 % ] vs 1 [ 1 % ] ) , and nausea and vomiting ( 2 [ 2 % ] vs 3 [ 4 % ] ) . Six serious adverse events were reported by three patients and were judged to be unrelated to study drug : in the ALD403 group , one patient had four serious adverse events and one had one serious adverse event , and in the placebo group , one patient had one serious adverse event . There were no differences in vital signs or laboratory safety data between the two treatment groups . The mean change in migraine days between baseline and weeks 5-8 was -56 ( SD 30 ) for the ALD403 group compared with -46 ( 36 ) for the placebo group ( difference -10 , 95 % CI -20 to 01 ; one-sided p = 00306 ) . No safety concerns were noted with an intravenous dose of ALD403 1000 mg . This study also provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of ALD403 in the preventive treatment of migraine in patients with a high monthly frequency of migraine days .

       " ' Polycystic liver disease ( PLD ) , the most common extrarenal manifestation of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) , has become more prevalent as a result of increased life expectancy , improved renal survival , reduced cardiovascular mortality , and renal replacement therapy . No studies have fully characterized PLD in large cohorts . We investigated whether liver and cyst volumes are associated with volume of the hepatic parenchyma , results from liver laboratory tests , and patient-reported outcomes . We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline liver volumes , measured by magnetic resonance imaging , and their association with demographics , results from liver laboratory and other tests , and quality of life . The data were collected from a randomized , placebo-controlled trial underway at 7 tertiary-care medical centers to determine whether the combination of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II-receptor blocker was superior to the inhibitor alone , and whether low blood pressure ( < 110/75 mm Hg ) was superior to standard blood pressure ( 120-130/70 -80 mm Hg ) , in delaying renal cystic progression in 558 patients with ADPKD , stages 1 and 2 chronic kidney disease , and hypertension ( age , 15-49 y ) . We found hepatomegaly to be common among patients with ADPKD . Cysts and parenchyma contributed to hepatomegaly . Cysts were more common and liver and cyst volumes were greater in women , increasing with age . Patients with advanced disease had a relative loss of liver parenchyma . We observed small abnormalities in results from liver laboratory tests , and that splenomegaly and hypersplenism were associated with PLD severity . Higher liver volumes were associated with a lower quality of life . Hepatomegaly is common even in early stage ADPKD and is not accounted for by cysts alone . Parenchymal volumes were larger , compared with liver volumes of patients without ADPKD or with those predicted by standardized equations , even among patients without cysts . The severity of PLD was associated with altered biochemical and hematologic features , as well as quality of life . ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT00283686 .',\n",
       " ' Peripancreatic fluid collections ( PFCs ) have been adequately drained using multiple plastic stents placed in a single-step endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) procedure . Recent reports have presented the usefulness of metal stents for this procedure ; however , there has been no prospective comparative study on their effectiveness and safety . We conducted a prospective randomized study to compare multiple plastic stents with fully covered , self-expanding metal stents ( FCSEMSs ) for the drainage of PFCs . Between January 2012 and May 2013 , patients with PFCs demonstrated by various modalities were enrolled in our study . Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a FCSEMS or plastic stents for EUS-guided PFC drainage . The procedure time , technical success rate , and adverse event rates of the PFCs were evaluated . 50 patients ( 41 men ) were included and randomly assigned to either the FCSEMS group ( n = 25 ) or the plastic stent group ( n = 25 ) . The median procedure time with FCSEMS was significantly shorter than with plastic stents ( 15.0 min vs. 29.5 min , P < 0.01 ) . The technical success rate was 100 % for both groups . The clinical success rate was 20 out of 23 for FCSEMS and 20 out of 22 for plastic stents ( P = 0.97 ) . No adverse events occurred in the FCSEMS group , while adverse events occurred in two patients in the plastic stent group ( P = 0.16 ) . One recurrence was observed during follow-up in the FCSEMS group and none in the plastic stent group ( P = 0.15 ) . EUS-guided PFC drainage with FCSEMSs is comparable to such drainage with plastic stents in terms of technical feasibility , efficacy , and safety ; however , the use of FCSEMSs may also simplify and shorten the procedure .

       " ' It is projected that in Australia there will be between 28 % and 48 % of palliative care patients living alone by the year 2031 . As such , it will become increasingly important to provide appropriate home-based care in order to support these patients to be cared for and die at home . This study explored the experiences of community-based palliative care cancer patients who live alone without a caregiver and what psychosocial issues they face . Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted with eight participants , and constant comparison was used for the analysis . Four main themes emerged : ( 1 ) loss of social networks ; ( 2 ) maintaining independence ; ( 3 ) balancing independence and the need for assistance ; and ( 4 ) planning for the end of life . Participants balanced independence with the need to accept help in order to maintain independence . Participants became more flexible about their preferred place of death . The practice implications for working with people close to death who are living alone are that supports and assistance may be needed to maintain social networks and also a sense of independence .',\n",

In clinical trials , the processes leading to publication can be complex from choice and prioritization of analytic topics through to journal submission and revisions . As little literature exists on the publication process for multicenter trials , we describe the development , implementation , and effectiveness of such a process in a multicenter trial . The Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis ( HALT-C ) trial included a data coordinating center ( DCC ) and clinical centers that recruited and followed more than 1,000 patients . Publication guidelines were approved by the steering committee , and the publications committee monitored the publication process from selection of topics to publication . A total of 73 manuscripts were published in 23 peer-reviewed journals . When manuscripts were closely tracked , the median time for analyses and drafting of manuscripts was 8months . The median time for data analyses was 5months and the median time for manuscript drafting was 3months . The median time for publications committee review , submission , and journal acceptance was 7months , and the median time from analytic start to journal acceptance was 18months .

       " ' Several evidences have supported the benefits of home blood pressure monitoring ( HBPM ) in improving hypertension awareness and control . However , little was known about the use of HBPM by hypertensive patients in primary care in China . A cross-sectional questionnaire survey on HBPM use was conducted on 1915 hypertensive patients in Xinzhuang County Hospital in Shanghai , and the factors related to regular use of HBPM were also determined . Overall , 1011 of the 1915 participants engaged in using HBPM , among whom 786 individuals used HBPM more than once a month . Of the 1011 HBPM users , 25.42 % chose a mercury sphygmomanometer , 33.55 % used wrist-cuff electronic devices , and 46.5 % selected arm-cuff electronic devices . In addition , 73 % of HBPM users reported HBP readings to their general practitioners . Compared with the less frequent users , patients who used HBPM daily were likely to report their blood pressure ( BP ) values to the doctors depending on notebook or mechanical memory than on their own memories ( P < 0.001 ) . Moreover , patients with college education were 2.7 times more likely than those with middle school education or less to engage in frequent HBPM use ( odds ratio = 2.71 , 95 % confidence interval = 2.03-3 .61 ) . This local community survey showed that 40 % of hypertension patients used HBPM frequently in primary care in China . However , certain patients chose the improper BP monitoring device or questionable reporting methods . Therefore , the use of arm-cuff electric devices with multiple memory storage or a home BP telemonitoring system should be promoted by health education targeted at hypertensive patients .',\n",

Arm support ( AS ) training showed improvement of unsupported arm function in chronic stroke . To examine the effect of weight-supported arm training combined with computerized exercises on arm function and capacity , compared with dose-matched conventional reach training in subacute stroke patients . In a single-blind , multicenter , randomized controlled trial , 70 subacute stroke patients received 6 weeks of training with either an AS device combined with computerized exercises or dose-matched conventional training ( CON ) . Arm function was evaluated pretraining and posttraining by Fugl-Meyer assessment ( FM ) , maximal reach distance , Stroke Upper Limb Capacity Scale ( SULCS ) , and arm pain via Visual Analogue Scale , in addition to perceived motivation by Intrinsic Motivation Inventory posttraining . FM and SULCS scores and reach distance improved significantly within both groups . These improvements and experienced pain did not differ between groups .

       " ' Rates of retention in care of HIV-positive pregnant women in care programs in Nigeria remain generally poor with rates around 40 % reported for specific programs . Poor quality of services in health facilities and long waiting times are among the critical factors militating against retention of these women in care . The aim of the interventions in this study is to assess whether a continuous quality improvement intervention using a Breakthrough Series approach in local district hospitals and primary health care clinics will lead to improved retention of HIV-positive women and mothers . A cluster randomized controlled trial with 32 health facilities randomized to receive a continuous quality improvement/Breakthrough Series intervention or not . The care protocol for HIV-infected pregnant women and mothers is the same in all sites . The quality improvement intervention started 4 months before enrollment of individual HIV-infected pregnant women and initially focused on reducing waiting times for women and also ensuring that antiretroviral drugs are dispensed on the same day as clinic attendance . The primary outcome measure is retention of HIV-positive mothers in care at 6 months postpartum . Results of this trial will inform whether quality improvement interventions are an effective means of improving retention in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programs and will also guide where health system interventions should focus to improve the quality of care for HIV-positive women . This will benefit policymakers and program managers as they seek to improve retention rates in HIV care programs .',\n",

Descriptive statistics were applied , and Pearson 's chi-squared ( P0 .05 ) or non-overlapping 95 % confidence intervals were interpreted as significant effects . 116 patients ( 16 % ) had diabetes , 100 of these gave informed consent and medical data were available . BGL treatment was as follows : ( 1 ) insulin only ( 32 % ) , ( 2 ) insulin and oral antidiabetics ( OADs ) ( 15 % ) , ( 3 ) OADs only ( 27 % ) and ( 4 ) no drugs ( 26 % ) . Patients with cognitive impairment were less likely to receive medical treatment ( P = 0.04 ) . CBGM and HbA1c measurements were performed for 73 % and 77 % of patients , respectively . Mean HbA1c was 7.3 % ( 57 mmol/mol ) , 46 % of patients had an HbA1c < 7.0 % ( 53 mmol/mol ) , and CBGM consistent with risk of hypoglycemia was found for 60 % of these patients . Prevalence of diabetes and BGL treatment in Norwegian nursing homes is comparable to other European countries . Although special care seems to be taken when choosing treatment for patients with cognitive impairment , there are signs of overtreatment in the population as a whole .

       " ' To investigate whether the negative quality of life result of a large randomized exercise intervention study ( BREX ) was due to considerable spontaneous recovery after adjuvant treatments . The change in QoL was studied in the control patients of the BREX study ( Group 1 ) and a group of similar follow-up patients that did not participate in any intervention study ( Group 2 ) . QoL was measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 with the breast cancer module supplement 6 and 12 months after surgery . QoL improved in both groups between 6 and 12 months after surgery . The improvement was similar in both groups for global QoL and for most of the QoL sub-scales . No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that participation in an exercise intervention per se significantly improves QoL . Spontaneous improvement in QoL began during the first six months after the primary treatments , which might have confounded the results of the intervention of the BREX study .',\n",

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) , cortisol and glucose levels were measured . Patients were blinded to the treatment condition . Fifty patients entered the study ( n = 25 per group ) . Anxiety score and withdrawal responses during rocuronium injection were significantly reduced in the CES group compared with the control group . Pain score was significantly lower in the CES group than in the control group , 1 h and 4 h post surgery . There were no significant differences in ACTH , cortisol and glucose levels . CES pretreatment appears to reduce the level of preoperative anxiety , injection pain of rocuronium and postoperative pain . However , CES pretreatment did not affect stress hormone responses .',\n",
       " ' To compare visual outcomes following photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) , PRK with mitomycin C ( MMC-PRK ) , and LASEK in moderate and high myopia in military personnel . This prospective , randomized contralateral eye study included 167 patients 21 years or older with manifest spherical equivalent -5.99 1.40 diopters ( D ) ( range : -3.88 to -9.38 D ) randomized to either MMC-PRK or LASEK treatment in their dominant eye and conventional PRK without MMC in the fellow eye . All procedures were performed using the LADARVision 4000 Excimer Laser System ( Alcon Surgical Inc. , Ft. Worth , TX ) . High - and low-contrast visual acuities , manifest refraction , endothelial cell count , and corneal haze were evaluated up to 12 months postoperatively . At 12 months postoperatively , visual outcomes were comparable among the treatment groups . Corneal haze of any grade was less common in MMC-PRK compared to PRK at 1 month ( 21.4 % vs 31.0 % ; P < .01 ) and 3 months ( 12.8 % vs 35.9 % ; P = .03 ) postoperatively ; it was also less common in MMC-PRK compared to LASEK at 1 month ( 21.4 % vs 55.9 % ; P < .01 ) , 3 months ( 12.8 % vs 42.4 % ; P < .01 ) , and 6 months ( 12.2 % vs 36.4 % ; P = .03 ) postoperatively . Haze rate ( grade 0.5 or higher ) was comparable between LASEK and PRK . Clinically significant haze ( grade 2 or higher ) developed after PRK ( 4 eyes ) and LASEK ( 2 eyes ) , but not after MMC-PRK . MMC-PRK showed some benefits in minimizing corneal haze formation . One year after surgery , there was no discernible difference in the postoperative refractive outcomes among the three methods .',\n",

To assess the safety and tolerability of both formulations . A total of 33 healthy male subjects , aged 29 6 years ( BMI : 23.9 2.5 kg/m2 ) completed this single center , open-label , randomized , 2-period cross-over study with single dose administrations under fasting conditions and coadministration with naltrexone for safety reasons . Administrations of both investigational products were separated by a washout period of at least 2 weeks , i.e. , 13 treatmentfree days . The total dose for each subject was 2 x 5 mg resulting in 10 mg levomethadone hydrochloride . For pharmacokinetic evaluation , blood samples were withdrawn until 72 hours postdose . A validated non-stereoselective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method ( LC-MS/MS ) was applied for the determination of levomethadone in plasma . The lower limit of quantitation was 0.100 ng/mL . Adverse events were descriptively analyzed in the study population . The geometric means of the parameters related with the extent of total exposure of levomethadone , i.e. , AUC ( 0-tlast ) and AUC ( 0 - ) , were 244.422 ng x h/mL and 332.999 ng x h/mL for test and 246.837 ng x h/mL and 329.467 ngh/mL for reference , respectively . The geometric means of the peak exposure for levomethadone , i.e. , Cmax , were 8.923 ng/mL for test and 8.635 ng/mL for reference . The point estimates ( PEs ) of the Test/Reference ( T/R ) adjusted geometric mean ratios of AUC ( 0-last ) , AUC ( 0 - ) , and C ( max ) were 99.20 % , 101.42 % , and 104.11 % , respectively , and all of them showed 90 % - confidence intervals ( CIs ) within the range of 80.00 - 125.00 % as suggested by regulatory requirements for bioequivalence assessment In total , 21 subjects experienced 55 AEs during the study , the most frequently reported AE , i.e. , headache , accounted for 13 out of the total 55 AEs ( 23.6 % ) and no AEs of severe intensity were reported . Bioequivalence could be demonstrated in terms of rate and extent of absorption after administration of test and reference products under naltrexone protection .

We performed a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial of oral glutamic acid as a preventive agent in pediatric patients with cancer who would be receiving vincristine therapy for at least 9 consecutive weeks ( Stratum 1 = Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma ) or 4 consecutive weeks in conjunction with steroids ( Stratum 2 = Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma ) . At designated time points , a scored neurologic exam using the Modified Balis Pediatric Scale of Peripheral Neuropathies was performed to document neurologic toxicity . Between 2007 and 2012 , 250 patients were enrolled ( Stratum 1 = 50 , Stratum 2 = 200 ) . The glutamic acid treated group did not have a significantly lower percentage of neurotoxicity compared to placebo treated group either overall or within stratum or age subgroups . The only subgroup which was suggestive of treatment effect was for age . Patients 13 years or older showed a larger benefit in favor of glutamic acid ( P = 0.055 ) compared to patients less than 13 years ( P = 1.00 ) . Constipation was the most frequently reported ( 14 % ) Grade II or higher neurotoxicity . Vincristine-associated neurotoxicity in pediatric oncology remains a frequent complication of chemotherapy for multiple diagnoses with an approximate 30 % of patients affected . Glutamic acid is not effective for prevention in pre-adolescents . There is a suggestion of benefit in patients 13 years or older , but the study was not designed to provide adequate power to test the treatment effect within this age group alone .',\n",

A substudy included 46 patients from DA VINCI ( a randomized , double-masked Phase 2 study ) receiving either laser , 0.5 mg IAI every 4 weeks , 2 mg IAI every 4 weeks , 2 mg IAI every 8 weeks after 3 monthly doses ( 2q8 ) , or 2 mg IAI as-needed after 3 monthly doses for 52 weeks . Retinal sensitivity was measured in one ( central ) , five ( one central and four inner ) , and eight ( four inner and four outer ) optical coherence tomography subfields . Mean best-corrected visual acuity improvement in the subgroup at Week 52 was 3.3 letters with laser and ranged from 5.4 to 16.3 letters in the IAI groups . Retinal sensitivity of laser patients at Week 52 was comparable with baseline in the central optical coherence tomography subfield but decreased in the five and eight optical coherence tomography subfields . Compared with laser , retinal sensitivity significantly increased with IAI in the 2q8 and pooled IAI groups in the 5 and 8 optical coherence tomography subfields at Week 52 ( P < 0.05 ) . Intravitreal aflibercept injection improved best-corrected visual acuity and retinal sensitivity in this subgroup of patients . Laser may cause a deterioration of macular function that is not detectable with best-corrected visual acuity testing .',\n",
       " ' Prediction of radiographic progression ( RP ) in early rheumatoid arthritis ( eRA ) would be very useful for optimal choice among available therapies . We evaluated a multi-biomarker disease activity ( MBDA ) score , based on 12 serum biomarkers as a baseline predictor for 1-year RP in eRA . Baseline disease activity score based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS28-ESR ) , disease activity score based on C-reactive protein ( DAS28-CRP ) , CRP , MBDA scores and DAS28-ESR at 3months were analysed for 235 patients with eRA from the Swedish Farmacotherapy ( SWEFOT ) clinical trial . RP was defined as an increase in the Van der Heijde-modified Sharp score by more than five points over 1year . Associations between baseline disease activity measures , the MBDA score , and 1-year RP were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression , adjusted for potential confounders . Among 235 patients with eRA , 5 had low and 29 moderate MBDA scores at baseline . None of the former and only one of the latter group ( 3.4 % ) had RP during 1year , while the proportion of patients with RP among those with high MBDA score was 20.9 % ( p = 0.021 ) . Among patients with low/moderate CRP , moderate DAS28-CRP or moderate DAS28-ESR at baseline , progression occurred in 14 % , 15 % , 14 % and 15 % , respectively . MBDA score was an independent predictor of RP as a continuous ( OR = 1.05 , 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.08 ) and dichotomised variable ( high versus low/moderate , OR = 3.86 , 95 % CI 1.04 to 14.26 ) . In patients with eRA , the MBDA score at baseline was a strong independent predictor of 1-year RP . These results suggest that when choosing initial treatment in eRA the MBDA test may be clinically useful to identify a subgroup of patients at low risk of RP .

       " ' Results of an exploratory phase 2 study showed that insulin degludec , a basal insulin with an action profile of longer than 42 h , provided similar glycaemic control when injected three times a week ( IDeg 3TW ) to once-daily insulin glargine ( IGlar OD ) . To provide further evidence , we did two phase 3 trials to compare the efficacy and safety of IDeg 3TW with IGlar OD in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes . In two 26 week , randomised , open-label , parallel group , non-inferiority trials IDeg was injected Monday , Wednesday , and Friday before breakfast ( IDeg 3TW ( AM ) ) in the AM trial ( 94 sites in seven countries ) or with the evening meal ( IDeg 3TW ( PM ) ) in the PM trial ( 89 sites in seven countries ) , and compared with IGlar OD . Adults with type 2 diabetes ( HbA ( 1c ) 7.0-10 .0 % ; body-mass index 45 kg/m ( 2 ) ) were randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) without stratification by a central interactive response system to IDeg 3TW or IGlar OD . Both groups continued taking metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors . Insulin was titrated to achieve a prebreakfast self-monitored blood glucose ( SMBG ) concentration of between 3.9 and less than 5.0 mmol/L . The primary outcome was non-inferiority of IDeg 3TW compared with IGlar OD , as assessed by change in HbA ( 1c ) from baseline to 26 weeks ( non-inferiority limit of 0.4 % ) by ANOVA in an intent-to-treat analysis ( full analysis set ) . These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , numbers NCT01068678 and NCT01076647 . We recruited 460 patients for the AM trial ( IDeg 3TW ( AM ) , n = 230 ; IGlar OD , n = 230 ) and 467 patients for the PM trial ( IDeg 3TW ( PM ) , n = 233 ; IGlar OD , n = 234 ) . After 26 weeks , mean HbA decreased by 0.9 % ( IDeg 3TW ( AM ) ) and 1.3 % ( IGlar OD ) in the AM trial , and by 1.1 % ( IDeg 3TW ( PM ) ) and 1.4 % ( IGlar OD ) in the PM trial . Non-inferiority was not confirmed in either trial ( estimated treatment difference [ IDeg 3TW ( AM ) - IGlar OD ] 0.34 % , 95 % CI 0.18-0 .51 ; [ IDeg 3TW ( PM ) - IGlar OD ] 0.26 % , 0.11-0 .41 ) . Across the two trials , rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia ( SMBG < 3.1 mmol/L or severe [ needing assistance ] ) ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 episodes per patient-year and were similar for IDeg 3TW ( AM ) and IGlar OD ( estimated rate ratio [ ERR ] 1.04 , 95 % CI 0.69-1 .55 ) , but higher for IDeg 3TW ( PM ) than for IGlar OD ( ERR 1.58 , 1.03-2 .43 ) . The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was higher for IDeg 3TW ( AM ) than for IGlar OD ( ERR 2.12 , 1.08-4 .16 ) ; we noted no significant difference between IDeg 3TW ( PM ) and IGlar OD ( ERR 0.60 , 0.21-1 .69 ) . The inferior glycaemic control and increased risk of hypoglycaemia with IDeg 3TW compared with IGlar OD do not support a three-times-weekly dosing regimen . Novo Nordisk .',\n",
       " ' To evaluate the efficacy of two office-based treatments designed to prevent deterioration in glycemic control in young adolescents with type 1 diabetes in a randomized clinical trial . An individualized , more intensive family teamwork Coping skills program was compared with a diabetes Education treatment . A baseline assessment was followed by four brief treatment sessions and immediate posttesting over the course of 1.5 years . Families of 226 early adolescents ( ages 11-14 ) were randomized to receive either individualized coping skills education or diabetes education as adjunctive treatment to quarterly medical appointments . Continued follow-up occurred at 3.5-month intervals for a long-term follow-up of up to 3 years . A post hoc Usual Care group facilitated comparisons of glycemic control . Growth curve analysis showed that both treatment groups successfully prevented deterioration in adolescent disease care and simultaneously improved adolescent and parent quality of life that included indicators of more effective communication and reduced adherence barriers-without a concomitant increase in diabetes-related or general family conflict . However , contrary to expectation , the Education group was more efficacious than the Coping group in improvement of disease adherence and glycemic control over a 3-year follow-up . Low-intensity office-based quarterly treatment can maintain or improve disease care adherence in early adolescence when provided to adolescent/parent dyads . Better outcomes are achieved when treatment goals and techniques match the needs of the targeted population .',\n",

We compared the intraoperative effectiveness , hemodynamic effects , anaesthetic recovery times and patients satisfaction after isobaric levobupivacaine ( L ) 0.25 % versus L0 .50 % spinal anaesthesia during elective Caesarean deliveries performed with the Stark technique . In this double-blinded prospective study , seventy women undergoing elective caesarean delivery were randomized to receive either intrathecal 7.5 mg Levobupivacaine 0.25 % plus sufentanil 2.5 g ( Group L0 .25 ) , or intrathecal 7.5 mg L 0.50 % plus sufentanil 2.5 g ( GroupControl ) . The onset time , duration of anaesthesia , analgesia and sensory and motor block and hemodynamic parameters were measured from the beginning of spinal anaesthesia until four hours after spinal anaesthesia ( T240 ) . Onset time , duration of anaesthesia and haemodynamic variations were similar in the two groups . No patients required general anesthesia to complete surgery . Motor block vanished faster in Group L0 .25 as compared with GroupControl ( p < .01 ) . The cephalad spread of the 0.50 % solution was higher than that of the 0.25 % solution : no patient in Group L0 .25 experienced paresthesia of the upper limbs vs 14 % in GroupControl ( p < .05 ) . In GroupControl anaesthesia reached the dermatome T1 in 15 % of cases . Maternal and surgeon satisfaction was good in every patient . Levobupivacaine 7.5 milligrams at 0.25 % may be used as a suitable alternative to L 0.50 % for spinal anaesthesia for caesarean deliveris with the Stark technique with good maternal satisfaction . In Group L0 .25 a lower appearance of nausea and hypotension were observed and motor and sensitive block developed and diminished faster while no clinically significant differences in hemodynamic behavior was observed between groups .',\n",

Sixty eyes of 60 patients who underwent CCI during cataract surgery were randomized into two groups : femtosecond laser CCI ( 30 eyes ) and manual CCI ( 30 eyes ) . There were no significant between-group differences in uncorrected distance visual acuity , corrected distance visual acuity , surgically induced astigmatism , and corneal aberrations . Keratometric astigmatism was significantly lower in the femtosecond laser CCI group compared to the manual CCI group at 30 and 180 days ( P < .05 ) . Central endothelial cell count was significantly higher in the femtosecond laser CCI group compared to the manual CCI group at 7 and 30 days postoperatively ( P < .05 ) . A lower increase of corneal thickness at the incision site was observed at 30 and 180 days postoperatively in the femtosecond laser CCI group compared to the manual CCI group ( P < .05 ) . In addition , femtosecond laser CCI showed a better morphology ( lower percentage of endothelial and epithelial gaping and endothelial misalignment ) compared to manual CCI at different time points . Total phacoemulsification time was significantly lower in the femtosecond laser CCI group ( P < .05 ) . The femtosecond laser procedure was safe , efficient , and less damaging , as evidenced by lower central endothelial cell loss , lower increase of corneal thickness at the incision site , and better tunnel morphology compared to the manual technique .',\n",

Sixty-six children aged 1-6 years , of ASA physical status classes I or II for elective unilateral herniotomy under general anaesthesia without premedication were studied . The patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 33 each . Group B received caudal analgesia with plain bupivacaine 0.25 % at 1 ml/kg alone , while group BN received caudal analgesia using a mixture of plain bupivacaine 0.25 % at 1 ml/kg and neostigmine 1.5 ug / kg . Postoperatively , monitoring of pain scores and time to first analgesic request and , total dose of analgesics administered in the first 24 hours were recorded . All the patients participated throughout the study . There were no differences in the demographic characteristics ( age , weight , ASA status ) between the two groups . The mean duration of effective analgesia was significantly longer in group BN , 460 60.2 min . compared to group B , 286.4 47.8 mins , ( p < 0.001 ) . The analgesic requirement within the first 24 hours postoperatively was also significantly reduced in group BN , p < 0.001 . The study shows that the addition of low dose neostigmine to caudal isobaric bupivacaine significantly prolonged the time to first analgesic request and hence significantly reduced postoperative analgesic requirement .',\n",

       " ' Indomethacin is a potent analgesic that , similar to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , is associated with serious dose-related adverse events . There is a need for newer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products with improved tolerability . Low-dose submicron indomethacin was developed using SoluMatrix Fine Particle Technology to enable treatment at lower doses than commercially available indomethacin drug products . This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of submicron indomethacin 20 and 40 mg compared with indomethacin 50-mg capsules . This was a phase 1 , randomized , open-label , 4-period , 4-sequence , single-dose crossover study . Forty healthy volunteers received low-dose submicron indomethacin 20 - or 40-mg capsules , or indomethacin 50-mg capsules under fasting or fed conditions . Pharmacokinetic parameters and safety were assessed . Comparable fasting peak plasma levels ( mean standard deviation ) were demonstrated for submicron indomethacin 40 mg ( 2368.79 631.38 ng/ml ) and indomethacin 50 mg ( 2369.40 969.06 ng/ml ) . The overall systemic exposure ( geometric least squares mean ; 95 % CI ) was > 21 % lower for submicron indomethacin 40 mg ( 6007.71 ngh/mL ; 5585.73-6461 .58 ) compared with indomethacin 50 mg ( 7646.23 ngh/ml ; 7110.44-8222 .40 ) under fasting conditions . Food delayed the rate but did not affect the extent of indomethacin absorption from submicron indomethacin 40 mg . Submicron indomethacin 40 mg administration resulted in earlier time to peak plasma levels ( median 1.67 ; min-max 0.5-3 .5 hours ) under fasting conditions compared with indomethacin 50 mg ( 2.02 ; 0.5-5 .0 hours ) . Submicron indomethacin 20 and 40 mg were dose proportional and generally well tolerated . Compared with indomethacin 50 mg , submicron indomethacin 40 mg achieved similar peak plasma concentrations , lower systemic exposure , and a faster time to peak plasma concentration , indicating rapid absorption . The current formulation of low-dose submicron indomethacin has recently demonstrated efficacy in 2 phase 3 studies in patients with acute pain following bunionectomy and represents a new , low-dose treatment option for patients with acute pain .',\n",

       " ' Circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) have been shown to predict reduced survival outcomes in metastatic breast cancer . CTCs were analyzed in 2026 patients with early breast cancer before adjuvant chemotherapy and in 1492 patients after chemotherapy using the CellSearch System . After immuno-magnetic enrichment for cells expressing the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule , CTCs were defined as nucleated cells expressing cytokeratin and lacking CD45 . The patients were followed for a median of 35 months ( range = 0-54 ) . Kaplan-Meier analyses and the log-rank test were used for survival analyses . All statistical tests were two-sided . Before chemotherapy , CTCs were detected in 21.5 % of patients ( n = 435 of 2026 ) , with 19.6 % ( n = 136 of 692 ) of node-negative and 22.4 % ( n = 299 of 1334 ) of node-positive patients showing CTCs ( P < .001 ) . No association was found with tumor size , grading , or hormone receptor status . After chemotherapy , 22.1 % of patients ( n = 330 of 1493 ) were CTC positive . The presence of CTCs was associated with poor disease-free survival ( DFS ; P < .0001 ) , distant DFS ( P < .001 ) , breast cancer-specific survival ( P = .008 ) , and overall survival ( OS ; P = .0002 ) . CTCs were confirmed as independent prognostic markers in multivariable analysis for DFS ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 2.11 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.49 to 2.99 ; P < .0001 ) and OS ( HR = 2.18 ; 95 % CI = 1.32 to 3.59 ; P = .002 ) . The prognosis was worst in patients with at least five CTCs per 30 mL blood ( DFS : HR = 4.51 , 95 % CI = 2.59 to 7.86 ; OS : HR = 3.60 , 95 % CI = 1.56 to 8.45 ) . The presence of persisting CTCs after chemotherapy showed a negative influence on DFS ( HR = 1.12 ; 95 % CI = 1.02 to 1.25 ; P = .02 ) and on OS ( HR = 1.16 ; 95 % CI = 0.99 to 1.37 ; P = .06 ) CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest the independent prognostic relevance of CTCs both before and after adjuvant chemotherapy in a large prospective trial of patients with primary breast cancer .',\n",

We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single-session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers . This was a cluster-randomised , parallel-group , controlled trial . A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers ( median size = 11 ) . Participants were 223 smokers consuming 5 cigarettes per day , willing to quit and not using cessation aids ( 47.1 % females , M = 37.5 years [ SD = 11.8 ] , 86.1 % Swiss ) . Nicotine withdrawal , smoking abstinence self-efficacy , and adverse reactions were assessed at a 2-week follow-up . The main outcome , self-reported 30-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence , was assessed at a 6-month follow up . Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis . Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day , smoking abstinence self-efficacy , and nicotine withdrawal . At the 6-month follow up , 14.7 % in the hypnosis group and 17.8 % in the relaxation group were abstinent . The intervention had no effect on smoking status ( p = .73 ) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day ( p = .56 ) . Smoking abstinence self-efficacy did not differ between the interventions ( p = .14 ) at the 2-week follow-up , but non-smokers in the hypnosis group experienced reduced withdrawal ( p = .02 ) . Both interventions produced few adverse reactions ( p = .81 ) . A single session of group hypnotherapy does not appear to be more effective for smoking cessation than a group relaxation session .

Of the 79 subjects treated , 75 were evaluable , 35 in the eszopiclone group , and 40 in the placebo group . At baseline , the groups were comparable except for sleep latency . Of the three remaining sleep variables , total sleep time , nighttime awakenings , and sleep quality , the number of nighttime awakenings during the 6-week treatment period was significantly lower in the eszopiclone group than in the placebo group ( P = 0.03 ) . Of the three daytime variables , alertness , fatigue , and functioning , this was also the case for fatigue ( P = 005 ) . The headache variables , frequency , duration , and intensity , did not show a difference from placebo during the 6-week treatment period . The study did not meet primary endpoint , that is , the difference in total sleep time during the 6-week treatment period between eszopiclone and placebo was less than 40 minutes . Therefore , it failed to answer the question as to whether insomnia is , indeed , a risk factor for increased headache frequency and headache intensity in migraineurs .',\n",
       " ' The MAINTAIN study is an on-going RCT comparing high-dose micronutrient and anti-oxidant supplementation versus recommended daily allowance ( RDA ) vitamins in slowing HIV immune deficiency progression in ART-nave people with HIV infection . We planned analysis of the first 127 participants to determine the baseline prevalence of serum micronutrient deficiencies and correlates , as well as tolerance and adherence to study interventions . Participants receive eight capsules twice daily of 1 ) high-dose or 2 ) RDA supplements for two years and are followed-up quarterly for measures of immune deficiency progression , safety and tolerability . Regression analysis was used to identify correlates of micronutrient levels at baseline . Adherence was measured by residual pill count , self-report using the General Treatment Scale ( GTS ) and short-term recall HIV Adherence Treatment Scale ( HATS ) . Prior micronutrient supplementation ( within 30 days ) was 27 % at screening and 10 % of study population , and was not correlated with baseline micronutrient levels . Low levels were frequent for carotene ( 24 % < 1 nmol/L ) , vitamin D ( 24 % < 40 nmol/L ) and serum folate ( 20 % < 15 nmol/L ) . The proportion with B12 deficiency ( < 133 pmol/L ) was 2.4 % . Lower baseline levels of B12 correlated lower baseline CD4 count ( r = 0.21 , p = 0.02 ) with a 21 pmol/L reduction in B12 per 100 cells/L CD4 . Vitamin D levels were higher in men ( p < 0.001 ) . After a median follow-up of 1.63 years , there were 19 ( 15 % ) early withdrawals from the study treatment . Mean treatment adherence using pill count was 88 % . Subjective adherence by the GTS was 81 % and was moderately but significantly correlated with pill count ( r = 0.29 , p < 0.001 ) . Adherence based on short-term recall ( HATS ) was > 80 % in 75 % of participants . Micronutrient levels in asymptomatic HIV + persons are in keeping with population norms , but micronutrient deficiencies are frequent . Adherence levels are high , and will permit a valid evaluation of treatment effects . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00798772 .',\n",
       " ' Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) increases risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases . Low glycaemic index ( GI ) diets improve cardio-metabolic outcomes in insulin-resistant individuals . We examined the feasibility of lowering GI through GI-based-education among Asian post-GDM women . A 3-month investigation was carried out on 60 Malaysian women with a mean age of 31.0 + / - 4.5 years and a history of GDM . Subjects were randomised into two groups : LGIE and CHDR . The CHDR group received conventional healthy dietary recommendations only . The LGIE group received GI based-education in addition to conventional healthy dietary recommendations . At baseline and after 3-months , dietary intake of energy and macronutrient intakes including GI diet and glycaemic load was assessed using 3-day food records . Diabetes-Diet and GI-concept scores and physical activity levels were assessed using a questionnaire . Adherence to dietary instructions was measured at the end of 3 months . At the end of 3 months , the LGIE group had significant reductions in energy intake ( 241.7 + / - 522.4 Kcal , P = 0.037 , ES = 0.463 ) , total carbohydrate ( 48.7 + / - 83.5 g , P = 0.010 , ES = 0.583 ) , GI ( 3.9 + / - 7.1 , P = 0.017 , ES = 0.549 ) and GL ( 39.0 + / - 55.3 , P = 0.003 , ES = 0.705 ) and significant increases in protein ( 3.7 + / - 5.4 g , 0.003 , ES = 0.685 ) and diet fibre ( 4.6 + / - 7.3 g , P = 0.06 ) . The CHDR group had a significant reduction in fat only ( 5.7 + / - 9.4 g , P = 0.006 , ES = 0.606 ) . There was a 30 % increase in GI-concept scores in the LGIE group ( p < 0.001 ) . Changes in GI-concept scores correlated significantly to the reduction in dietary GI ( r = -0.642 , P = 0.045 ) . Dietary adherence was comparable in both groups . GI-education improves GI-concept knowledge and helps lower dietary glycaemic index among women with a history of GDM .',\n",

       " \" To determine the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention for smoking cessation during pregnancy . Parallel group , randomised controlled , multicentre trial . 13 hospitals in England , April 2009 to January 2014 . 789 pregnant smokers , aged 16-50 years and at 10-24 weeks ' gestation , who smoked at least one cigarette daily and were prepared to quit smoking one week after enrollment were randomised ( 1:1 ) ; 785 were included in the intention to treat analyses , with 392 assigned to the physical activity group . Interventions began one week before a target quit date . Participants were randomised to six weekly sessions of behavioural support for smoking cessation ( control ) or to this support plus 14 sessions combining supervised treadmill exercise and physical activity consultations . The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence from the target quit date until end of pregnancy , validated by exhaled carbon monoxide or salivary cotinine levels . To assess adherence , levels of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity were self reported and in a 11.5 % ( n = 90 ) random subsample of participants , physical activity was objectively measured by an accelerometer . No significant difference was found in rates of smoking abstinence at end of pregnancy between the physical activity and control groups ( 8 % v 6 % ; odds ratio 1.21 , 95 % confidence interval 0.70 to 2.10 ) . For the physical activity group compared with the control group , there was a 40 % ( 95 % confidence interval 13 % to 73 % ) , 34 % ( 6 % to 69 % ) , and 46 % ( 12 % to 91 % ) greater increase in self reported minutes carrying out physical activity per week from baseline to one week , four weeks , and six weeks post-quit day , respectively . According to the accelerometer data there was no significant difference in physical activity levels between the groups . Participants attended a median of four treatment sessions in the intervention group and three in the control group . Adverse events and birth outcomes were similar between the two groups , except for significantly more caesarean births in the control group than in the physical activity group ( 29 % v 21 % , P = 0.023 ) . Adding a physical activity intervention to behavioural smoking cessation support for pregnant women did not increase cessation rates at end of pregnancy . During pregnancy , physical activity is not recommended for smoking cessation but remains indicated for general health benefits . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN48600346 .\",\n",
       " ' Cisplatin and gemcitabine is the standard first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer ; expression of VEGF and its receptors is associated with adverse outcomes . We aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib ( an oral inhibitor of VEGF receptor 1 , 2 , and 3 ) to cisplatin and gemcitabine on progression-free survival . In this multicentre , placebo-controlled , randomised phase 2 study , we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed or cytologically confirmed advanced biliary tract cancer from hepatobiliary oncology referral centres in the UK . Patients were eligible if they had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 and an estimated life expectancy of longer than 3 months . Patients were given first-line cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy ( 25 mg/m ( 2 ) cisplatin and 1000 mg/m ( 2 ) gemcitabine [ on days 1 and 8 every 21 days , for up to eight cycles ] ) with either 20 mg oral cediranib or placebo once a day until disease progression . We randomly assigned patients ( 1:1 ) with a minimisation algorithm , incorporating the stratification factors : extent of disease , primary disease site , previous treatment , ECOG performance status , and centre . The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00939848 , and was closed on Sept 30 , 2014 ; results of the final analysis for the primary endpoint are presented . Between April 5 , 2011 , and Sept 28 , 2012 , we enrolled 124 patients ( 62 in each group ) . With a median follow-up of 122 months ( IQR 73-185 ) , median progression-free survival was 80 months ( 95 % CI 65-93 ) in the cediranib group and 74 months ( 57-85 ) in the placebo group ( HR 093 , 80 % CI 074-119 , 95 % CI 065-135 ; p = 072 ) . Patients who received cediranib had more grade 3-4 toxic effects than did patients who received placebo : hypertension ( 23 [ 37 % ] vs 13 [ 21 % ] ; p = 005 ) , diarrhoea ( eight [ 13 % ] vs two [ 3 % ] ; p = 005 ) ; platelet count decreased ( ten [ 16 % ] vs four [ 6 % ] ; p = 009 ) , white blood cell decreased ( 15 [ 24 % ] vs seven [ 11 % ] ; p = 006 ) and fatigue ( 16 [ 24 % ] vs seven [ 11 % ] ; p = 004 ) . Cediranib did not improve the progression-free survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine , which remains the standard of care . Although patients in the cediranib group had more adverse events , we recorded no unexpected toxic effects .

       " ' In the United Kingdom , licensed nicotine-containing products can be recommended to reduce the harm associated with smoking . Many smokers find currently available nicotine replacement products unsatisfactory . The arterial and venous pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of nicotine delivered via a novel inhaler device were determined . Results are reported for Parts A ( N = 18 ) and C ( N = 18 ) of a 4-part ( A-D ) Phase I study . Participants ( 18-55 years , 10 cigarettes/day , smoking within 1 hr of waking , expired carbon monoxide > 10 ppm on screening ) orally inhaled 2 single doses of nicotine ( 2 of 3 dose levels [ 0.22 , 0.45 , and 0.67 mg ] ) ( Part A ) and repeated hourly doses of 0.67 mg nicotine for 12 hr ( Part C ) , via the novel device . Arterial and venous PK and tolerability were assessed . In Part A , mean arterial plasma nicotine concentrations at 2 min after the start of inhalation were 1.10 , 2.06 , and 2.59 ng/mL for the 0.22 , 0.45 , and 0.67 mg doses , respectively . Mean maximum arterial plasma nicotine concentrations ( C ( max ) ) were 2.11 , 3.73 , and 4.38 ng/mL and mean times to C ( max ) were 10.2 , 7.3 , and 6.5 min after the start of inhalation for the 0.22 , 0.45 , and 0.67 mg doses , respectively . In Part C , the mean pre - and postdose venous plasma nicotine concentration increased steadily and fluctuated in the range 8-10 mg/mL after 9 hr . The novel device was well tolerated ; most adverse events were mild . The novel inhaler device delivers nicotine rapidly into the systemic circulation and offers a viable alternative to cigarettes for those finding it difficult to quit the behavioral and sensorial aspects of smoking .',\n",
       " ' The N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine , delivered via an intravenous route , has shown rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression . The current study was designed to test the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of intranasal ketamine in patients with depression who had failed at least one prior antidepressant trial . In a randomized , double-blind , crossover study , 20 patients with major depression were randomly assigned , and 18 completed 2 treatment days with intranasal ketamine hydrochloride ( 50 mg ) or saline solution . The primary efficacy outcome measure was change in depression severity 24 hours after ketamine or placebo , measured using the Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale . Secondary outcomes included persistence of benefit , changes in self-reports of depression , changes in anxiety , and proportion of responders . Potential psychotomimetic , dissociative , hemodynamic , and general adverse effects associated with ketamine were also measured . Patients showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms at 24 hours after ketamine compared to placebo ( t = 4.39 , p < .001 ; estimated mean Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale score difference of 7.6 3.7 ; 95 % confidence interval , 3.9-11 .3 ) . Response criteria were met by 8 of 18 patients ( 44 % ) 24 hours after ketamine administration compared with 1 of 18 ( 6 % ) after placebo ( p = .033 ) . Intranasal ketamine was well tolerated with minimal psychotomimetic or dissociative effects and was not associated with clinically significant changes in hemodynamic parameters . This study provides the first controlled evidence for the rapid antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine . Treatment was associated with minimal adverse effects . If replicated , these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with major depression .',\n",
       " ' High blood pressure is an important public health concern because it is highly prevalent and a risk factor for adverse health outcomes , including coronary heart disease , stroke , decompensated heart failure , chronic kidney disease , and decline in cognitive function . Observational studies show a progressive increase in risk associated with blood pressure above 115/75 mm Hg . Prior research has shown that reducing elevated systolic blood pressure lowers the risk of subsequent clinical complications from cardiovascular disease . However , the optimal systolic blood pressure to reduce blood pressure-related adverse outcomes is unclear , and the benefit of treating to a level of systolic blood pressure well below 140 mm Hg has not been proven in a large , definitive clinical trial . To describe the design considerations of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT ) and the baseline characteristics of trial participants . The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial is a multicenter , randomized , controlled trial that compares two strategies for treating systolic blood pressure : one targets the standard target of < 140 mm Hg , and the other targets a more intensive target of < 120 mm Hg . Enrollment focused on volunteers of age 50 years ( no upper limit ) with an average baseline systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg and evidence of cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease , 10-year Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score 15 % , or age 75 years . The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial recruitment also targeted three pre-specified subgroups : participants with chronic kidney disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m ( 2 ) ) , participants with a history of cardiovascular disease , and participants 75 years of age or older . The primary outcome is first the occurrence of a myocardial infarction ( MI ) , acute coronary syndrome , stroke , heart failure , or cardiovascular disease death . Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality , decline in kidney function or development of end-stage renal disease , incident dementia , decline in cognitive function , and small-vessel cerebral ischemic disease . Between 8 November 2010 and 15 March 2013 , Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial recruited and randomized 9361 people at 102 clinics , including 3331 women , 2648 with chronic kidney disease , 1877 with a history of cardiovascular disease , 3962 minorities , and 2636 75 years of age . Although the overall recruitment target was met , the numbers recruited in the high-risk subgroups were lower than planned . The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial will provide important information on the risks and benefits of intensive blood pressure treatment targets in a diverse sample of high-risk participants , including those with prior cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease , and those aged 75 years .',\n",

       " ' Animal studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in neurocognitive function and the response to antihypertensive therapy . We investigated the impact of circulating aldosterone and renin activity on cognition and cerebral hemodynamics at baseline and after antihypertensive therapy for 1 year . Participants were older adults ( n = 47 ; mean age = 71 years ) enrolled in a clinical trial . Routine antihypertensive medications were replaced with the study regimen to achieve a blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg . Executive function , memory , cerebral hemodynamics ( blood flow velocity ) , CO2 vasoreactivity ( measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography ) , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after the initiation of treatment . At baseline , higher levels of circulating aldosterone were associated with lower blood flow velocity ( = -0.02 ; P = 0.03 ) , lower CO2 vasoreactivity ( = -0.11 ; P = 0.007 ) , and decreased autoregulation abilities ( = -0.09 ; P = 0.01 ) . Those with higher levels of aldosterone at baseline demonstrated the greatest improvement in executive function ( P = 0.014 for the aldosterone effect ) and in CO2 vasoreactivity ( P = 0.026 for the aldosterone effect ) after 12 months of lowering blood pressure ( < 140/90 mm Hg ) . Plasma renin activity was not associated with any of the measures . Higher levels of aldosterone may be associated with decreased cerebrovascular function in hypertension . Those with higher aldosterone levels may benefit the most from lowering blood pressure . The role of aldosterone in brain health warrants further investigation in a larger trial .',\n",
       " \" To compare the difference in the clinical efficacy on cervical spondylosis between acupuncture at three lines of cervical Jiaji ( EX-B 2 ) and oral administration of jingfukang granules . Three hundred cases of cervical spondylosis were divided into an acupuncture group and a medication group , 150 cases in each one . In the acupuncture group , according to the different types of cervical spondylosis , acupuncture was applied at three lines of cervical Jiaji ( EX-B 2 ) , once a day . In the medication group , jingfukang granules were prescribed for oral administration , one bag each time , three times a day . The treatment of ten days made one session in the two groups and two sessions were required totally . Before and after two sessions of treatment , the clinical assessment scale for cervical spondylosis ( CASCS ) was adopted to evaluate the score of subjective symptoms , clinical physical signs and adaptability as well as the total score in the patients of the two groups and the efficacy was compared . The patients ' symptoms and physical signs were alleviated , the adaptability was improved and the score of each item and the total score were increased in the two groups after treatment ( all P < 0.01 ) . The improvements in the acupuncture group were better than those in the medication group ( all P < 0.01 ) . The curative and markedly effective rate was 90.7 % ( 136/150 ) in the acupuncture group , better than 66.0 % ( 99/150 ) in the medication group ( P < 0.01 ) . Acupuncture at three lines of cervical Jiaji ( EX-B 2 ) achieves the significant clinical efficacy on cervical spondylosis .

Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) for inoperable stage I NSCLC has shown promising results , but two independent , randomised , phase 3 trials of SABR in patients with operable stage I NSCLC ( STARS and ROSEL ) closed early due to slow accrual . We aimed to assess overall survival for SABR versus surgery by pooling data from these trials . Eligible patients in the STARS and ROSEL studies were those with clinical T1-2a ( < 4 cm ) , N0M0 , operable NSCLC . Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to SABR or lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling . We did a pooled analysis in the intention-to-treat population using overall survival as the primary endpoint . Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( STARS : NCT00840749 ; ROSEL : NCT00687986 ) . 58 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned ( 31 to SABR and 27 to surgery ) . Median follow-up was 402 months ( IQR 230-473 ) for the SABR group and 354 months ( 189-407 ) for the surgery group . Six patients in the surgery group died compared with one patient in the SABR group . Estimated overall survival at 3 years was 95 % ( 95 % CI 85-100 ) in the SABR group compared with 79 % ( 64-97 ) in the surgery group ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 014 [ 95 % CI 0017-1190 ] , log-rank p = 0037 ) .

In the surgery group , one patient had regional nodal recurrence and two had distant metastases ; in the SABR group , one patient had local recurrence , four had regional nodal recurrence , and one had distant metastases . Three ( 10 % ) patients in the SABR group had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events ( three [ 10 % ] chest wall pain , two [ 6 % ] dyspnoea or cough , and one [ 3 % ] fatigue and rib fracture ) . No patients given SABR had grade 4 events or treatment-related death . In the surgery group , one ( 4 % ) patient died of surgical complications and 12 ( 44 % ) patients had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events . Grade 3 events occurring in more than one patient in the surgery group were dyspnoea ( four [ 15 % ] patients ) , chest pain ( four [ 15 % ] patients ) , and lung infections ( two [ 7 % ] ) . SABR could be an option for treating operable stage I NSCLC . Because of the small patient sample size and short follow-up , additional randomised studies comparing SABR with surgery in operable patients are warranted .

Although antidepressant treatment is the most common therapy provided in routine practice , there is little evidence to guide second-line therapy for patients who have failed to respond to antidepressants . The aim of this paper is to describe the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial that measures the clinical effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) as an augmentation strategy to treat patients with non-psychotic major depression identified as suboptimal responders to usual depression care . The current study is a 16-week assessor-blinded randomised , parallel-groups superiority trial with 12-month follow-up at an outpatient clinic as part of usual depression care . Patients aged 20-65years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) Major Depressive Disorder who have experienced at least one failed trial of antidepressants as part of usual depression care , will be randomly assigned to receive CBT plus treatment as usual , or treatment as usual alone . The primary outcome is the change in clinician-rated 17-item GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( GRID-HAMD ) score at 16weeks , and secondary outcomes include severity and change in scores of subjective depression symptoms , proportion of responders and remitters , safety and quality of life . The primary population will be the intention-to-treat patients .

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a polyherbal ( test ) formulation on cognitive functions , inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in healthy elderly as well as senile dementia of Alzheimer 's type ( SDAT ) patients . A randomized double-blind placebo - and active-controlled clinical trial was performed in healthy elderly subjects and SDAT patients with an age range of 60-75 years . The polyherbal test formulation along with a placebo was given to healthy elderly subjects while the SDAT patients received either the test formulation containing extracts of Bacopa monnieri ( whole plant ) , Hippophae rhamnoides ( leaves and fruits ) and Dioscorea bulbifera ( bulbils ) at a dose of 500 mg or donepezil drug ( Aricept ) at a dose of 10 mg , twice daily , for a period of 12 months . After every three months , cognitive functions were assessed by determining the mini mental state examination ( MMSE ) score , digital symbol substitution ( DSS ; subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised ) , immediate and delayed word recall ( digital memory apparatus-Medicaid systems , Chandigarh , India ) , attention span ( Attention Span Apparatus-Medicaid systems , Chandigarh , India ) , functional activity questionnaire ( FAQ ) and depression ( geriatric depression scale ) scores . Further inflammatory markers and level of oxidative stress were analyzed using standard biochemical tests . The trial was performed in 109 healthy subjects and 123 SDAT patients of whom 97 healthy subjects and 104 SDAT patients completed the study . Administration of the test formulation for a period of 12 months was effective in improving cognitive functions in the SDAT patients , when compared to the donepezil-treated group , as determined by the DSS ( 38.984 3.016 vs 35.852 4.906 , P = 0.0001 ) , word recall immediate ( 3.594 1.003 vs 2.794 0.593 , P < 0.0001 ) and attention span ( 4.918 1.239 vs 4.396 0.913 , P = 0.0208 ) scores .

The level of inflammation and oxidative stress was markedly reduced in the SDAT patients treated with the test formulation when compared to the donepezil-treated group indicating a likely mechanism of action of the test formulation ( homocysteine 30.22 3.87 vs 44.73 7.11 nmol/L , P < 0.0001 ; C-reactive protein [ CRP ] 4.751 1.149 vs 5.887 1.049 mg/L , P < 0.0001 ; tumour necrosis factor alpha [ TNF - ] 1139.45 198.87 vs 1598.77 298.52 pg/ml , P < 0.0001 ; superoxide dismutase [ SOD ] 1145.92 228.75 vs 1296 225.72 U/g Hb , P = 0.0013 ; glutathione peroxidase [ GPx ] 20.78 3.14 vs 25.99 4.11 U/g Hb , P < 0.0001 ; glutathione [ GSH ] 9.358 2.139 vs 6.831 1.139 U/g Hb , P < 0.0001 ; thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [ TBARS ] 131.62 29.68 vs 176.40 68.11 nmol/g Hb , P < 0.0001 ) . Similarly , when healthy elderly subjects treated with the test formulation for 12 months were compared to the placebo group , a significant ( P < 0.001 ) improvement in cognitive measures ( MMSE , DSS , word recall delayed but not immediate , attention span , FAQ and depression scores ) and a reduction in inflammation ( reduction in homocysteine , CRP , IL-6 and TNF - levels ) and oxidative stress levels ( reduction in SOD , GPx and TBARS and increase in GSH ) was observed . This indicated a protective effect of the test formulation in managing cognitive decline associated with the ageing process . The results of this study demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this novel polyherbal formulation for the management and treatment of SDAT .\",\n",

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of treatment with docetaxel plus ramucirumab or placebo as second-line treatment for patients with stage IV non-small-cell-lung cancer ( NSCLC ) after platinum-based therapy . In this multicentre , double-blind , randomised phase 3 trial ( REVEL ) , we enrolled patients with squamous or non-squamous NSCLC who had progressed during or after a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen . Patients were randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) with a centralised , interactive voice-response system ( stratified by sex , region , performance status , and previous maintenance therapy [ yes vs no ] ) to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m ( 2 ) and either ramucirumab ( 10 mg/kg ) or placebo on day 1 of a 21 day cycle until disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal , or death . The primary endpoint was overall survival in all patients allocated to treatment . We assessed adverse events according to treatment received . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01168973 . Between Dec 3 , 2010 , and Jan 24 , 2013 , we screened 1825 patients , of whom 1253 patients were randomly allocated to treatment . Median overall survival was 105 months ( IQR 51-212 ) for 628 patients allocated ramucirumab plus docetaxel and 91 months ( 42-180 ) for 625 patients who received placebo plus docetaxel ( hazard ratio 086 , 95 % CI 075-098 ; p = 0023 ) .

       " \" We compared the long-term success of desmopressin sublingual lyophilisate formulation and enuretic alarm therapy in children with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis , and determined predictive factors for treatment success . A total of 142 children with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were randomized to receive treatment consisting of desmopressin or enuretic alarm for 6 months . Treatment compliance and response were reviewed monthly in each patient using a 30-day bed-wetting diary . Outcomes were assessed according to International Children 's Continence Society criteria , and success rates at 6 and 12 months were compared for desmopressin and enuretic alarm . Additional intention to treat analyses were performed , considering cases with missing data as failures . Possible demographic factors predicting success were investigated by logistic regression analysis . Overall 4 children ( 5.2 % ) in the desmopressin group and 20 ( 30.7 % ) in the enuretic alarm group withdrew after randomization . Based on patients who completed 6 months of treatment , success ( more than 90 % reduction in wet nights per month ) was achieved in 76.8 % and 61.8 % of children in the desmopressin and enuretic alarm groups , respectively . At 12 months 77.8 % of those receiving desmopressin and 75 % of those treated with enuretic alarm had success . However , long-term success rate was significantly higher with desmopressin ( 68.8 % vs 46.2 % ) if intention to treat population was considered . Multivariate analysis revealed treatment group , severity of enuresis and monthly income as independent predictors of cure at 6 months . In compliant patients desmopressin lyophilisate and enuretic alarm provided equivalent success at the end of treatment and after extended followup . Alarm therapy had a high rate of early withdrawal from therapy and consequently lower rates of success on intention to treat analyses . Severe enuresis ( more than 5 wet nights weekly ) is an important predictive factor for cure after first-line treatment .\",\n",
       " ' Following from previous research in which post-encoding suggestions of threat led to the development of a memory bias ( in the presumed absence of an attentional bias ; Senn & Radomsky , 2012 ) , we sought to examine whether the development of a similar threat-relevant memory bias could be fostered via a purely informational pathway . A vignette about a classroom interaction was read aloud to ( n = 96 ) undergraduate participants who then completed a post-encoding recall test . Participants were told that the experimenter forgot to read the last sentence of the vignette , and were then randomly assigned either to the Threat condition , in which the additional statement indicated that a character in the vignette had a highly contagious flu , or to the No-Threat condition , in which the additional statement indicated that a character in the vignette had been accepted to graduate school . A second recall test was then administered . Participants in the Threat condition ( but not those in the No-Threat condition ) demonstrated aproportionate memory bias in favor of threatening information . This bias was not evident at the initial recall test . Time spent engaging in active recall was not assessed . Also , although the study was designed to minimize demand characteristics , it is possible that these played a role . An explicit memory bias for threat can be created through informational means alone , even when no threat was present at encoding . Results are discussed in terms of pathways to fear and of cognitive approaches to understanding and treating anxiety disorders .',\n",

Over the recent decades , in particular , significant progress has been made in this field . The authors present an overview of current knowledge of chronic wound healing , pointing out the surgeons role in the process of chronic wound management . Using surgical therapy , we are able to heal a chronic wound in a shorter period of time , particularly if the treatment is accelerated by the application of platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) as a source of growth factors . The pilot randomized prospective study included four patients with chronic wounds of the lower leg after previous failure of conservative therapy who were indicated for skin transplantation . Following previous vacuum-assisted closure therapy , the patients undergoing skin transplantation were prospectively randomized into two groups . Autologous PRP was used in one of the groups and standard skin transplantation without PRP was performed in the other one . In the PRP group , 99 % of the wound areas were healed on the 15th day after the operation . In the other group , 90 % of the areas were healed on the 15th day following the operation . In the PRP group , complete healing of the defect occurred in both patients at 15 and 20 days post-surgery . In the second group , one patient completely healed within 28 days ; the other one was not fully healed even at 3 months post-surgery . Most patient groups at great risk may benefit from the method using PRP , as well as patients with chronic wounds who have failed conventional methods available for both general and local therapy .

       " \" To compare lag-screw sliding characteristics and fixation stability of two cephalomedullary nails ( CMN ) with different lag-screw designs ( solid and telescopic ) , we conducted a biomechanical study and an analysis of clinical results . Six pairs of cadaver femurs with simulated intertrochanteric fractures were randomly assigned to one of two CMN fixations . Femur constructs were statically then cyclically loaded on an MTS machine . Lag-screw sliding and inferior and lateral femoral head displacements were measured , following which failure strength of the construct was determined . Forty-five patients with intertrochanteric fractures treated with these CMN were identified . Medical records and radiographs were reviewed and analyzed using Fisher 's exact test and Student 's t test to determine lag-screw sliding . No difference was seen with cycling in inferior femoral head displacement between the two screw designs . The solid screw had an average inferior head displacement of 1.75 mm compared with 1.59 mm for the telescoping screw ( p = 0.772 ) . The solid lag screws slid an average of 2.79 mm lateral from the nail , whereas the telescoping screws slid an average of 0.27 mm ( p = 0.003 ) . In our clinical review , the average lateral sliding of the telescoping screw was 0.5 mm and of the solid screw was 3.7 mm ( p < 0.001 ) . Despite differences in lateral sliding , there were no reoperations for prominent or painful hardware in either group . Both designs are acceptable devices for stabilization of intertrochanteric fractures . Clinical and biomechanical data demonstrate greater lateral sliding in the solid lag-screw group , making for greater potential for lateral-sided hip pain in CMNs with solid lag screws as opposed to telescoping lag screws .\",\n",

The authors examined the use of ECT as an augmentation to clozapine for treatment-refractory schizophrenia . In a randomized single-blind 8-week study , patients with clozapine-resistant schizophrenia were assigned to treatment as usual ( clozapine group ) or a course of bilateral ECT plus clozapine ( ECT plus clozapine group ) . Nonresponders from the clozapine group received an 8-week open trial of ECT ( crossover phase ) . ECT was performed three times per week for the first 4 weeks and twice weekly for the last 4 weeks . Clozapine dosages remained constant . Response was defined as 40 % reduction in symptoms based on the psychotic symptom subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale , a Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) - severity rating < 3 , and a CGI-improvement rating 2 . The intent-to-treat sample included 39 participants ( ECT plus clozapine group , N = 20 ; clozapine group , N = 19 ) . All 19 patients from the clozapine group received ECT in the crossover phase . Fifty percent of the ECT plus clozapine patients met the response criterion . None of the patients in the clozapine group met the criterion . In the crossover phase , response was 47 % .

Lipid uptake was different for the two materials : total lipid ( p < 0.007 ) , cholesterol esters ( p < 0.001 ) , cholesterol ( p < 0.001 EW only ) , and triglycerides/phospholipids ( p < 0.001 ) were higher for balafilcon A , whereas fatty acid ( p < 0.0025 EW only ) was higher for etafilcon A. The ratio of the extracted lipids was also different : higher percentages of triglycerides/phospholipids ( p < 0.001 ) and cholesterol ( p < 0.001 EW only ) for balafilcon A and higher percentages of fatty acids/di - and monoglycerides ( p < 0.014 ) for etafilcon A. Total lipid uptake was highly material dependent . Both laboratories measured a greater uptake of lipids by the silicone hydrogel than the hydrogel material , a difference that was evident after only 10 hours of DD . Total lipid uptake was greater after 7 days of EW compared with 10 hours of DD . Of interest for contact lens spoliation and its avoidance was the differential lipid uptake profile , indicating material selectivity . Whereas greater differentiation between materials was possible after 7 days of EW for each material , the lipid uptake profile was similar for DD and EW , indicating a greater material effect than a wear modality effect .',\n",
       " ' This study was done to investigate how nicardipine , remifentanil and dexmedetomidine affect the balance of the autonomic nervous system in patients receiving controlled hypotension under general anaesthesia by evaluating heart rate variability indices . Sixty-two patients were randomly allocated to either the nicardipine-sevoflurane ( Group N , n = 21 ) , remifentanil-sevoflurane ( Group R , n = 21 ) or dexmedetomidine-sevoflurane ( Group D , n = 20 ) group for controlled hypotension during orthognathic surgery . Electrocardiogram data acquisition was done after vital sign stabilization following anaesthesia induction ( T1 ) and 30min after controlled hypotension was induced ( T2 ) . Total power and low frequency ( LF ) power was significantly decreased at T2 compared with T1 in all groups , while a decrease in high frequency ( HF ) power was only observed in Group N ( P < 0.001 ) . LF/HF ratios of Group R and D were significantly suppressed at T2 compared with T1 ( P = 0.001 and P < 0.001 , respectively ) , but was increased Group N ( P = 0.009 ) . The LF/HF ratio of Group N was significantly higher than Group R and D at T2 ( P < 0.001 in both ) , with Group D showing a significantly lower LF/HF ratio compared with Group R ( P < 0.001 ) . Remifentanil and dexmedetomidine did not have sympathetic nervous system-stimulating effects during controlled hypotension , while remifentanil seemed to be superior in preserving the overall balance in autonomic nervous system activity . Nicardipine was found to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system , which may be problematic in patients vulnerable to disturbances in the autonomic nervous system .',\n",

To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder . This 8-week , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study was conducted from July 2010 to January 2012 among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder ( DSM-IV-TR ) . Eligible subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms : vortioxetine 10 mg , vortioxetine 20 mg , or placebo once daily for 8 weeks . Subjects who completed the 8-week trial entered a 2-week blinded discontinuation period to assess potential discontinuation symptoms . The primary endpoint was the least squares mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score from baseline . Key secondary outcomes were analyzed in the following prespecified sequential order : MADRS response ( 50 % decrease from baseline in total score ) , Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score , change from baseline in MADRS total score in subjects with baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score 20 , MADRS remission ( total score 10 ) , and change from baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale total score ( all at week 8 ) . A total of 462 subjects were randomized to placebo ( n = 157 ) , vortioxetine 10 mg ( n = 155 ) , and vortioxetine 20 mg ( n = 150 ) . Mean ( SE ) reductions from baseline in MADRS total score ( week 8 ) were -10.77 ( 0.807 ) , -12.96 ( 0.832 ) , and -14.41 ( 0.845 ) for the placebo , vortioxetine 10 mg ( P = .058 vs placebo ) , and vortioxetine 20 mg ( P = .002 vs placebo ) groups . MADRS response/remission was achieved in 28.4 % / 14.2 % , 33.8 % / 21.4 % , and 39.2 % / 22.3 % of subjects , respectively , in the 3 groups . Only MADRS response for vortioxetine 20 mg significantly separated from placebo ( P = .044 ) . Treatment was well tolerated , with the most frequently reported adverse events consisting of nausea , headache , diarrhea , and dizziness . Vortioxetine 20 mg significantly reduced MADRS total score at 8 weeks in this study population . Overall , vortioxetine was well tolerated in this study .

       " ' Experimental evidence has indicated the benefits of simvastatin for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage . Two randomized placebo-controlled pilot trials that used the highest clinically approved dose of simvastatin ( 80 mg daily ) gave positive results despite the fact that a lower dose of simvastatin ( 40 mg daily ) did not improve clinical outcomes . We hypothesized that a high dose of 80 mg of simvastatin daily for 3 weeks would reduce the incidence of delayed ischemic deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with a lower dose ( 40 mg of simvastatin daily ) and lead to improved clinical outcomes . The study design was a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial . Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( presenting within 96 hours of the ictus ) from 6 neurosurgical centers were recruited for 3 years . The primary outcome measure was the presence of delayed ischemic deficits , and secondary outcome measures included a modified Rankin disability score at 3 months and an analysis of cost-effectiveness . No difference was observed between the groups treated with the higher dose or the lower dose of simvastatin in the incidence of delayed ischemic deficits ( 27 % versus 24 % ; odds ratio , 1.2 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.7-2 .0 ; P = 0.586 ) or in the rate of favorable outcomes ( modified Rankin Scale score , 0-2 ) at 3 months ( 73 % versus 72 % ; odds ratio , 1.1 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.6-1 .9 ; P = 0.770 ) .

       " \" We examined the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk and blood pressure in African Americans . Stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a clinical trial , augmented by a Markov model of lifetime cost-effectiveness . In 2 urban academic primary care practices , we randomized African American patients with uncontrolled hypertension to a 6-month intervention of office practice and peer coach behavioral support ( N = 136 ) or informational brochures about CHD risk factors ( N = 144 ) . Costs were estimated from the perspective of the provider . Outcomes included estimated CHD events avoided over 6 months and reduction in systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ( mm Hg ) . Subgroup analysis was performed for compliers who received an `` effective '' dose of the peer coach and office staff visits . Long-term cost-effectiveness was estimated by applying the clinical trial cost and effectiveness into a Markov model of CHD risk . The average cost for the behavioral support intervention group was $ 435.36 compared with $ 74.39 for the brochure control group . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) was $ 47 per mm Hg reduction in SBP and $ 453,419 per CHD event avoided in 6 months . Modeled over a 10-year horizon , the intervention had an ICER only as high as $ 3998 per incremental quality-adjusted life-year . A community-primary care practice behavioral intervention to reduce hypertension in African Americans with sustained uncontrolled hypertension does not appear to be cost-effective in the first 6 months . If intervention results are sustained over the long term , the program may be cost-effective over the patient 's lifetime .\",\n",
       " ' Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) eligible for enrollment in a randomized controlled trial for a novel oral anticoagulant , the ARISTOTLE trial . A secondary objective was to describe the reasons for trial ineligibility . We performed a cross-sectional study of an unselected population including 2274 patients in Skellefte , Sweden with at least one verified episode of AF on or before December 31 , 2010 . Patients were classified as suitable or unsuitable for anticoagulant treatment according to current guidelines . The enrollment criteria from the ARISTOTLE trial were extracted from the original publication and applied to the population . Among all patients with AF , 1579 were classified as suitable for anticoagulant treatment . Of these , only 658 patients ( 42 % ) were eligible for participation in the ARISTOTLE trial . Among the 921 patients ineligible for participation , 498 did not meet the ECG criteria , 272 had psychosocial problems , and in addition , 78 patients were excluded due to both of these criteria . Our study shows that a majority of the patients in an unselected population with AF suitable for anticoagulant treatment were ineligible for participation in the ARISTOTLE trial . The applicability of the ARISTOTLE trial is therefore unknown for a considerable proportion of patients with AF in real life .',\n",

A prospective randomized , US FDA investigational device exemption pivotal trial of the Mobi-C cervical artificial disc was conducted at 24 centers in the U.S. Three hundred thirty patients with degenerative disc disease were randomized and treated with cervical total disc replacement ( 225 patients ) or the control treatment , anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) ( 105 patients ) . Patients were followed up at regular intervals for 4 years after surgery . At 48 months , both groups demonstrated improvement in clinical outcome measures and a comparable safety profile . Data were available for 202 TDR patients and 89 ACDF patients in calculation of the primary endpoint . TDR patients had statistically significantly greater improvement than ACDF patients for the following outcome measures compared with baseline : Neck Disability Index scores , 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary scores , patient satisfaction , and overall success . ACDF patients experienced higher subsequent surgery rates and displayed a higher rate of adjacent-segment degeneration as seen on radiographs . Overall , TDR patients maintained segmental range of motion through 48 months with no device failure . Four-year results from this study continue to support TDR as a safe , effective , and statistically superior alternative to ACDF for the treatment of degenerative disc disease at 2 contiguous cervical levels .

       " \" The objective of this study was to test the effect of a brief educational and counseling intervention on increasing the uptake of free testing for Chlamydia trachomatis ( chlamydia ) and Neisseria gonorrhea ( gonorrhea ) among young female emergency department ( ED ) patients . Women are particularly vulnerable to more serious consequences of these infections due to asymptomatic presentation . Increased testing is important to detect , treat , and halt the spread of these infections among asymptomatic women . This was a randomized controlled trial . Research assistants ( RAs ) approached female patients in two EDs . Eligible patients were between 18 and 35 years of age , who reported having sex with males , but were not attending the ED for either treatment of sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) or testing for possible STI exposure . Participants responded to survey questions about their lifetime and past 3-month substance use , number of recent sexual partners , condom use , and perception of risks for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections . Following the survey , the RAs randomized participants into study control or treatment arms . Each treatment arm participant received a brief educational/counseling intervention from the RA . The brief intervention focused on the woman 's personal risks for chlamydia and gonorrhea and condoms attitudes and usage . As the primary outcome of this study , participants were offered free urine tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea infection postintervention or post-survey completion , depending on group assignment . A total of 171 women completed the baseline assessment and were offered chlamydia and gonorrhea testing . The mean ( SD ) age was 26 ( 4.76 ) years , 18 % were Hispanic , and 12 % were Spanish-speaking only . The brief intervention that was offered to increase these women 's awareness of their STI risk did not result in increased acceptance of testing ; 48 % in the brief intervention group accepted testing ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 32 % to 64 % ) versus 36 % in the control group ( 95 % CI = 19 % to 53 % ) . In a multivariable logistic regression , only self-identifying as being Hispanic was associated with greater willingness to be tested . Of the asymptomatic women tested ( n = 71 ) , five tested positive for chlamydia . This represents a positivity rate of 7 % . There were no positive test results for gonorrhea . Women who reported high-risk factors for STI , such as younger age ( 25 years ) , having sex in the past 90 days without using condoms , identified substance use , or previous STI , were not more likely to accept the offer of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing . The brief intervention used in this study did not increase the uptake of testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea infections in this sample , in comparison to receiving no intervention . Although Hispanic women were more likely to accept chlamydia and gonorrhea testing , it is concerning that those women who report STI risk factors were not more likely to accept the offer of chlamydia and gonorrhea testing . Future research should focus on the refinement of an intervention protocol to focus on prior STI and lack of condom use to increase the uptake of testing among this high-risk group .\",\n",
       " ' Preclinical studies support the hypothesis that endogenous neuroactive steroids mediate some effects of alcohol . The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dutasteride inhibition of 5-reduced neuroactive steroid production on subjective responses to alcohol in adult men . Using a within-subject factorial design , 70 men completed four randomly ordered monthly sessions in which pretreatment with 4 mg dutasteride or placebo was paired with a moderate dose of alcohol ( 0.8 g/kg ) or placebo beverage . The pharmacologic effect of dutasteride was measured by an assay of serum androstanediol glucuronide . Self-reports of alcohol effects were obtained at 40-min intervals following alcohol administration using the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale ( BAES ) and the Alcohol Sensation Scale ( SS ) . We used linear mixed models to examine the effects of dutasteride and alcohol on BAES and SS responses and the interaction of dutasteride with the GABRA2 alcohol dependence-associated polymorphism rs279858 . We also examined whether exposure to dutasteride influenced drinking in the weeks following each laboratory session . A single 4-mg dose of dutasteride produced a 70 % reduction in androstanediol glucuronide . Dutasteride pretreatment reduced alcohol effects on the BAES sedation and SS anesthesia scales . There was no interaction of dutasteride with rs279858 . Heavy drinkers had fewer heavy drinking days during the 2 weeks following the dutasteride sessions and fewer total drinks in the first week after dutasteride . These results provide evidence that neuroactive steroids mediate some of the sedative effects of alcohol in adult men and that dutasteride may reduce drinking , presumably through its effects on neuroactive steroid concentrations .',\n",
       " ' Tapentadol prolonged release ( PR ) is effective and well tolerated for chronic osteoarthritis , low back , and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain . To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol PR compared with placebo and morphine controlled release ( CR ) for managing moderate to severe chronic malignant tumor-related pain . Randomized-withdrawal , parallel group , active - and placebo-controlled , double-blind phase 3 study ( NCT00472303 ) . Primary , secondary , and tertiary care settings in 16 countries . Eligible patients ( pain intensity 5 [ 11-point numerical rating scale ] on prior analgesics ) were randomized ( 2:1 ) and titrated to their optimal dose of tapentadol PR ( 100-250 mg bid ) or morphine sulfate CR ( 40-100 mg bid ) over 2 weeks . Morphine sulfate immediate release 10 mg was permitted as needed for rescue medication ( no maximum dose ) . Patients who completed titration and , during the last 3 days of titration , had mean pain intensity < 5 ( based on twice-daily ratings ) and mean rescue medication use = 20 mg/day continued into a 4-week maintenance period ; patients who received morphine CR during titration continued taking morphine CR , and those who received tapentadol PR were re-randomized ( 1:1 ) to tapentadol PR or placebo bid . Response during maintenance ( primary efficacy endpoint ) was defined as having : ( 1 ) completed the maintenance period , ( 2 ) a mean pain intensity < 5 during maintenance , and ( 3 ) used an average of = 20 mg/day of rescue medication during maintenance . Response at the end of titration was defined similarly , with pain intensity and rescue medication averages based on the last 3 days of titration . Of 622 patients screened , 496 were randomized , treated during titration , and evaluable for safety ; 327 were re-randomized , treated during maintenance , and evaluable for safety ; and 325 were evaluable for efficacy . The adjusted responder rate estimate during maintenance ( logistic regression adjusting for treatment group , pooled center , and pain intensity at start of maintenance ) was significantly higher with tapentadol PR ( 64.3 % ) than with placebo ( 47.1 % ; odds ratio ( OR ) , 2.02 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.12 - 3.65 ] ; P = 0.02 ) . Based on responder rates at the end of titration , tapentadol PR ( 76.0 % [ 174/229 ] ) was non-inferior to morphine CR ( 83.0 % [ 83/100 ] ) . The lower limit of the 95 % CI for the between-groups difference ( -15.5 % ) was within the pre-specified 20 % non-inferiority margin . During titration , incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were 50.0 % ( 169/338 ) with tapentadol PR and 63.9 % ( 101/158 ) with morphine CR ; incidences of nausea , vomiting , and dry mouth were lower with tapentadol PR than with morphine CR . During maintenance , incidences of TEAEs were 56.3 % ( 63/112 ) , 62.3 % ( 66/106 ) , and 62.4 % ( 68/109 ) with placebo , tapentadol PR , and morphine CR , respectively . Statistical comparisons between tapentadol PR and morphine CR were limited to descriptive statistics during the maintenance period because of the pre-selection of responders to tapentadol PR or morphine CR during titration . Results obtained during maintenance indicate that tapentadol PR ( 100-250 mg bid ) is effective compared with placebo for managing moderate to severe chronic malignant tumor-related pain . Based on results obtained during titration , tapentadol PR provides comparable efficacy to that of morphine sulfate CR ( 40-100 mg bid ) , but is associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability .',\n",

This was a prospective , randomized , controlled , double-blind trial . One hundred twenty patients with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment scheduled to undergo external buckling surgery and cryocoagulation were asked to participate . Participants were randomly assigned either to receive 3-5mL Chirocaine ( 22.5-37 .5 mg ) or 3-5mL Chirocaine and 1mL clonidine ( 150g ) before surgery . Main outcome measures were postoperative pain , use of analgesics , blood pressure , and plasma clonidine concentration . Nine nonrandomized patients consented to give blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis . There was no significant difference in pain score between both groups . On average , the use of analgesic medication occurred later in the clonidine group ( P = 0.0004 ) , but there was no statistical difference in the first time that postoperative medication was taken ( P = 0.13 ) . Blood pressure was reduced by clonidine ( systolic : P = 0.02 , diastolic : P = 0.006 ) . Clonidine levels could be demonstrated during the 24-h postoperative period , with an average half-life of 22h . Administration of clonidine as an adjuvant to conventional retrobulbar block is safe , and delays the postoperative use of analgesics . The reduction of postoperative pain and the time of first use of analgesic medication , however , were not significantly different between groups . Further , pain scores in both study groups remained low . Therefore , the beneficial effect of clonidine in conventional scleral buckle surgery appears to be limited .',\n",

Preclinical research has shown that compounds produced by the olive tree ( Olea europaea ) , may protect from bone loss , by increasing osteoblast activity at the expense of adipocyte formation . The aim of this exploratory study was to obtain a first insight on the effect of intake of an olive extract on bone turnover in postmenopausal women with decreased bone mass ( osteopenia ) . For that , a double blind , placebo-controlled study was performed in which participants were randomly allocated to either treatment or placebo groups . 64 osteopenic patients , with a mean bone mineral density ( BMD ) T-score between -1.5 and -2.5 in the lumbar spine ( L2-L4 ) were included in the study . PARTICIPANTS received for 12 months daily either 250 mg/day of olive extract and 1000 mg Ca ( treatment ) or 1000 mg Ca alone ( placebo ) . Primary endpoints consisted of evaluation of bone turnover markers . Secondary endpoints included BMD measurements and blood lipid profiles . After 12 months , the levels of the pro-osteoblastic marker osteocalcin were found to significantly increase in the treatment group as compared to placebo . Simultaneously , BMD decreased in the placebo group , while remaining stable in the treatment group . In addition , improved lipid profiles were observed , with significant decrease in total - and LDL-cholesterol in the treatment group . This exploratory study supports preclinical observations and warrants further research by showing that a specific olive polyphenol extract ( Bonolive ) affects serum osteocalcin levels and may stabilize lumbar spine BMD . Moreover , the improved blood lipid profiles suggest additional health benefits associated to the intake of the olive polyphenol extract .',\n",

Patients with down-regulated ERCC1 on Oxaliplatin or up-regulated TOPO Ion Irinotecan have longer survival and better curative effect . And chemotherapies guided by drug related molecule detection may boost curative effects in metastatic colorectal cancer .\",\n",
       " ' Biodegradable-polymer drug-eluting stents ( BP-DES ) were developed to be as effective as second-generation durable-polymer drug-eluting stents ( DP-DES ) and as safe > 1 year as bare-metal stents ( BMS ) . Thus , very late stent thrombosis ( VLST ) attributable to durable polymers should no longer appear . To address these early and late aspects , 2291 patients presenting with acute or stable coronary disease needing stents 3.0 mm in diameter between April 2010 and May 2012 were randomly assigned to biolimus-A9-eluting BP-DES , second-generation everolimus-eluting DP-DES , or thin-strut silicon-carbide-coated BMS in 8 European centers . All patients were treated with aspirin and risk-adjusted doses of prasugrel . The primary end point was combined cardiac death , myocardial infarction , and clinically indicated target-vessel revascularization within 2 years . The combined secondary safety end point was a composite of VLST , myocardial infarction , and cardiac death . The cumulative incidence of the primary end point was 7.6 % with BP-DES , 6.8 % with DP-DES , and 12.7 % with BMS . By intention-to-treat BP-DES were noninferior ( predefined margin , 3.80 % ) compared with DP-DES ( absolute risk difference , 0.78 % ; -1.93 % to 3.50 % ; P for noninferiority 0.042 ; per protocol P = 0.09 ) and superior to BMS ( absolute risk difference , -5.16 ; -8.32 to -2.01 ; P = 0.0011 ) . The 3 stent groups did not differ in the combined safety end point , with no decrease in events > 1 year , particularly VLST with BP-DES . In large vessel stenting , BP-DES appeared barely noninferior compared with DP-DES and more effective than thin-strut BMS , but without evidence for better safety nor lower VLST rates > 1 year . Findings challenge the concept that durable polymers are key in VLST formation . http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier : NCT01166685 .',\n",
       " ' The World Health Organization recommends vitamin A supplementation ( VAS ) at routine vaccination contacts after 6 months of age based on the assumption that it reduces mortality by 24 % . The policy has never been evaluated in randomized controlled trials for its effect on overall mortality . We conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of VAS with vaccines . We randomized children aged 6 to 23 months 1:1 to VAS ( 100000 IU if aged 6-11 months , 200000 IU if aged 12-23 months ) or placebo at vaccination contacts in Guinea-Bissau . Mortality rates were compared in Cox proportional-hazards models overall , and by gender and vaccine . Between August 2007 and November 2010 , 7587 children were enrolled . Within 6 months of follow-up 80 nonaccident deaths occurred ( VAS : 38 ; placebo : 42 ) . The mortality rate ratio ( MRR ) comparing VAS versus placebo recipients was 0.91 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.59-1 .41 ) and differed significantly between boys ( MRR 1.92 [ 0.98-3 .75 ] ) and girls ( MRR 0.45 [ 0.24-0 .87 ] ) ( P = .003 for interaction between VAS and gender ) . At enrollment , 42 % ( 3161/7587 ) received live measles vaccine , 29 % ( 2154/7587 ) received inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccines , and 21 % ( 1610/7587 ) received both live and inactivated vaccines . The effect of VAS did not differ by vaccine group . This is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of the policy on overall mortality . VAS had no overall effect , but the effect differed significantly by gender . More trials to ensure an optimal evidence-based vitamin A policy are warranted .',\n",
       " \" Sedation-analgesia is recommended for comfortable colonoscopy procedures , which are invasive and can be painful . This study aimed to compare the combinations of propofol-alfentanil and propofol-fentanyl for sedation-analgesia in elective colonoscopy patients . This prospective and randomized study was planned in ASA I-II groups and included 80 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years . Sedation-analgesia induction was performed as 1 g.kg ( -1 ) fentanyl , 1mg . kg ( -1 ) propofol in the propofol-fentanyl group ( Group PF ) and 10 g.kg ( -1 ) alfentanil , 1mg . kg ( -1 ) propofol in the propofol-alfentanil group ( Group PA ) . Patients ' scores were limited to 3-4 values on the Ramsey Sedation Scale ( RSS ) by 0.5 mg.kg ( -1 ) bolus additional doses of propofol in sedation-analgesia maintenance . We recorded demographical data , heart rate , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , oxygen saturation of hemoglobin ( SpO2 ) , RSS value , colonoscopy time , total dose of propofol , complications , recovery time , and discharge time , as well as colonoscopist and patient satisfaction scores . MAP at the 15 ( th ) minute in Group PA was significantly higher than in Group PF ( p = 0.037 ) . Group PA 's beginning mean heart rate was higher than the mean heart rate at subsequent readings ( p = 0.012 , p = 0.002 ) . The mean total propofol dose of Group PA was significantly higher than the total dose of Group PF ( p = 0.028 ) . The mean recovery time of Group PA was significantly longer than that of Group PF ( p = 0.032 ) . Fentanyl provides better operative conditions and reduces the need for additional propofol doses . These advantages cause a shorter recovery time . Therefore , propofol-fentanyl is superior to the propofol-alfentanil for sedation-analgesia in colonoscopy .\",\n",
       " ' To investigate the immediate effects of manipulation of bilateral sacroiliac joints ( SIJs ) on the plantar pressure distribution in asymptomatic participants in the standing position . Randomized , controlled , double-blind clinical trial . Sixty-two asymptomatic men and women ( mean age , 20.662.56 years ) randomly assigned to 2 groups . The experimental group underwent mobilization without tension of the hips in the supine position and high-velocity , low-amplitude manipulation in the SIJs bilaterally . The control group underwent only mobilization , without tension of the hips in supine position . Pre - and postintervention outcomes measured by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation of the participants included a baropodometric analysis performed by using a force platform . Baseline between-group differences were examined with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . A chi-square test was used for categorical data . Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) was used to assess differences between groups , with the preintervention value as covariant ( 95 % confidence level ) . At baseline , no variables significantly differed between groups . Baropodometric analysis showed statistically significant differences in the location of the maximum pressure point in the experimental group ( p = 0.028 ) . Pre - and postintervention analysis with ANCOVA showed statistically significant differences between both groups in the left hindfoot load percentage ( interaction p = 0.0259 ; ANCOVA p = 0.0277 ) , right foot load percentage ( ANCOVA p = 0.0380 ) , and surface of the right forefoot ( interaction p = 0.0038 ) . There was also a significant effect in the variables that analyze the entire foot ( left foot : surface [ interaction p = 0.0452 ] , percentage of load [ ANCOVA p = 0.0295 ] ) and between both groups ( right foot : weight [ interaction p = 0.0070 ; ANCOVA p = 0.0296 ] ) . Sacroiliac joint manipulation applied bilaterally in asymptomatic persons resulted in immediate changes in load distribution on plantar support in the standing position .

       " ' New-onset diabetes after transplantation ( NODAT ) is a common complication after renal transplantation . There are limited available oral drugs to treat hyperglycaemia in this population owing to reduced renal function , potential interactions with immunosuppressive drugs and adverse effects such as hypoglycaemic events that may increase the cardiovascular risk . This study was initiated to investigate efficacy and safety of sitagliptin treatment that may represent a novel alternative in renal transplant recipients . Nineteen long-term stable renal transplant recipients with NODAT were included in a controlled , cross-over study and randomized to first receive either sitagliptin 50-100 mg/day or a sitagliptin-free period of 4 weeks . Median age ( interquartile range , IQR ) was 67 ( 62-72 ) years ( 12 males/7 females ) , all studied 1 ( 1-3 ) year after transplantation . The immunosuppressive regimen was a triple calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy . Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) with insulin and C-peptide responses and laser Doppler ( LD ) flowmetry assessment of endothelial function were performed at baseline and after each treatment period . Home measurements of plasma glucose were performed daily during the study . The median ( IQR ) first - and second-phase insulin secretion responses increased significantly by 56.3 % ( 45.2-112 .6 % , P = 0.005 ) and 39.3 % ( 26.5-81 .0 % , P = 0.006 ) , respectively , following sitagliptin treatment as compared with no sitagliptin treatment . Fasting and 2-h plasma glucose concentrations fell significantly { 0.9 mmol/L [ 0.5-1 .7 mmol/L ( 16.2 mg/dL ) , P = 0.003 ] and 2.9 mmol/L [ 0.5-6 .4 mmol/L ( 52.3 mg/dL ) , P = 0.004 ] , respectively } , as did also home measurements of plasma glucose . Endothelial function and plasma markers of cardiovascular risk were unaffected . No serious adverse events were observed . Two mild and asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were observed in combination with glipizide . Sitagliptin increases insulin secretion and reduces fasting and postprandial plasma glucose in renal transplant recipients with NODAT . The short-term treatment was well tolerated , and sitagliptin seems safe in this population .',\n",
       " ' Sepsis , a leading cause of death in critically ill patients , is the result of complex interactions between the infecting microorganisms and the host responses that influence clinical outcomes . We evaluated the prognostic value of presepsin ( sCD14-ST ) , a novel biomarker of bacterial infection , and compared it with procalcitonin ( PCT ) . This is a retrospective , case-control study of a multicenter , randomized clinical trial enrolling patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in ICUs in Italy . We selected 50 survivors and 50 non-survivors at ICU discharge , matched for age , sex and time from sepsis diagnosis to enrollment . Plasma samples were collected 1 , 2 and 7 days after enrollment to assay presepsin and PCT . Outcome was assessed 28 and 90 days after enrollment . Early presepsin ( day 1 ) was higher in decedents ( 2,269 pg/ml , median ( Q1 to Q3 ) , 1,171 to 4,300 pg/ml ) than in survivors ( 1,184 pg/ml ( median , 875 to 2,113 ) ; P = 0.002 ) , whereas PCT was not different ( 18.5 g/L ( median 3.4 to 45.2 ) and 10.8 g/L ( 2.7 to 41.9 ) ; P = 0.31 ) . The evolution of presepsin levels over time was significantly different in survivors compared to decedents ( P for time-survival interaction = 0.03 ) , whereas PCT decreased similarly in the two groups ( P = 0.13 ) . Presepsin was the only variable independently associated with ICU and 28-day mortality in Cox models adjusted for clinical characteristics . It showed better prognostic accuracy than PCT in the range of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ( area under the curve ( AUC ) from 0.64 to 0.75 vs. AUC 0.53 to 0.65 ) . In this multicenter clinical trial , we provide the first evidence that presepsin measurements may have useful prognostic information for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock . These preliminary findings suggest that presepsin may be of clinical importance for early risk stratification .',\n",

In this prospective , double-blind , parallel-group clinical trial , 97 consecutive subjects with MOH were randomized ( simple randomization using computer-generated numbers ) for treatment with either 400mg/day celecoxib ( for the first 5 days then decreased at a rate of 100mg every 5 days ) or prednisone 75 mg/day orally ( for the first 5 days then tapered off every 5 days ) . Subjects who met the International Headache Society criteria for MOH were included in the trial . The change in headache days and intake of rescue medication were considered as primary outcomes while the change in headache severity defined as a secondary outcome . Patients treated with celecoxib experienced lower headache intensity during the first 3 weeks after withdrawal ( after 3 weeks , the median of visual analog scale was 3 for patients in celecoxib group vs 4.5 for prednisone group [ P < .001 ] ) . However , headache frequency and the need for rescue medication intake were not different between 2 groups . During withdrawal in MOH , in order to reduce headache days or rescue medication intake , using either of celecoxib or prednisone as a bridge is not different .',\n",
       " ' Short-term dietary glucose supplementation has been shown to accelerate the gastric emptying rate of both glucose and fructose solutions . The aim of this study was to examine gastric emptying rate responses to monosaccharide ingestion following short-term dietary fructose supplementation . The gastric emptying rate of a fructose solution containing 36 g of fructose and an equicaloric glucose solution containing 39.6 g glucose monohydrate were measured in 10 healthy non-smoking men with and without prior fructose supplementation ( water control ) using a randomized crossover design . Gastric emptying rate was assessed for a period of 1 h using the [ ( 13 ) C ] breath test with sample collections at baseline and 10-min intervals following drink ingestion . Additionally , appetite ratings of hunger , fullness , and prospective food consumption were recorded at baseline and every 10 min using visual analog scales . Increased dietary fructose ingestion resulted in significantly accelerated half-emptying time of a fructose solution ( mean = 48 , SD = 6 versus 58 , SD = 14 min control ; P = 0.037 ) , whereas the emptying of a glucose solution remained unchanged ( mean = 85 , SD = 31 versus 78 , SD = 27 min control ; P = 0.273 ) . Time of maximal emptying rate of fructose was also significantly accelerated following increased dietary fructose intake ( mean = 33 , SD = 6 versus 38 , SD = 9 min control ; P = 0.042 ) , while it remained unchanged for glucose ( mean = 45 , SD = 14 versus 44 , SD = 14 min control ; P = 0.757 ) . No effects of supplementation were observed for appetite measures . Three d of supplementation with 120 g/d of fructose resulted in an acceleration of gastric emptying rate of a fructose solution but not a glucose solution .',\n",

Eighty eyes of 80 candidates for cataract extraction were randomized into two groups : femtosecond laser ( 40 eyes ) and manual ( 40 eyes ) . The overall anterior chamber depth variation was significantly lower in the femtosecond laser group compared to the manual group during follow-up ( P < .001 ) . At 30 and 180 days postoperatively , the mean spherical equivalent showed a hyperopic shift ( 0.090.28 diopters [ D ] ) in the femtosecond laser group and a myopic shift in the manual group ( -0.250.18 D ) . Median absolute error was not significantly different between the two groups with standard formulas ranging between 0.29 and 0.64 ( Hoffer Q ) in the femtosecond laser group and between 0.24 ( SRK-T ) and 0.55 D ( Hoffer Q ) in the manual group . There was a significant lower deviation from intended versus achieved capsulotomy/capsulorhexis area in the femtosecond laser group ( P < .001 ) compared to the manual group . The femtosecond laser group showed better IOL centration compared to the manual group at all time periods ( P < .001 ) . Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was related to a lower overall variability of anterior chamber depth compared to conventional cataract surgery with more stable postoperative refraction . The two techniques did not show significant differences of prediction error .',\n",
       " ' Insulin-sensitive tissues ( muscle , liver ) of individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are in a state of low-grade inflammation , characterised by increased Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) expression and TLR-driven signalling . However , the cause of this mild inflammatory state is unclear . We tested the hypothesis that a prolonged mild increase in plasma NEFA will increase TLR expression and TLR-driven signalling ( nuclear factor B [ NFB ] and mitogen-activated kinase [ MAPK ] ) and impair insulin action in muscle of lean healthy individuals . Twelve lean , normal-glucose-tolerant participants were randomised to receive a 48 h infusion ( 30 ml/h ) of saline or Intralipid followed by a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp . Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed before and during the clamp . Lipid infusion impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity ( p < 0.01 ) . The elevation in circulating NEFA increased expression of TLR3 , TLR4 and TLR5 , and several MAPK ( MAPK8 , MAP4K4 , MAP2K3 ) and inhibitor of B kinase-NFB ( CHUK [ IKKA ] , c-REL [ REL ] and p65 [ RELA , NFKB3 , p65 ] ) signalling genes ( p < 0.05 ) . The lipid infusion also increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) phosphorylation ( p < 0.05 ) and tended to reduce the content of inhibitor of kappa B ( p = 0.09 ) . The muscle content of most diacylglycerol , ceramide and acylcarnitine species was unaffected . In summary , insulin resistance induced by prolonged low-dose lipid infusion occurs together with increased TLR-driven inflammatory signalling and impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation . A sustained , mild elevation in plasma NEFA is sufficient to increase TLR expression and TLR-driven signalling ( NFB and MAPK ) in lean individuals . The activation of this pathway by NEFA may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in humans . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01740817 .',\n",

Multicentre randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation , blinded assessments and intention-to-treat analysis . Forty-nine walking children ( 28 males ) aged 7-13 years with spastic cerebral palsy and severity of the disability classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System level I-III . The intervention group followed a 6-month physical activity stimulation program involving counselling through motivational interviewing , home-based physiotherapy , and 4 months of fitness training . The control group continued their usual paediatric physiotherapy . Primary outcomes were walking activity ( assessed objectively with an activity monitor ) and parent-reported physical activity ( Activity QUESTIONnaire for Adults and Adolescents ) . Secondary outcomes were : mobility capacity , consisting of Gross Motor Function Measure-66 ( GMFM-66 ) , walking capacity and functional strength , fitness ( aerobic and anaerobic capacity , muscle strength ) , self-reported fatigue , and attitude towards sport ( child and parent ) . Assessments were performed at baseline , 4 months , 6 months and 12 months . There were no significant intervention effects for physical activity or secondary outcomes at any assessment time . Positive trends were found for parent-reported time at moderate-to-vigorous intensity ( between-group change ratio = 2.2 , 95 % CI 1.1 to 4.4 ) and GMFM-66 ( mean between-group difference = 2.8 points , 95 % CI 0.2 to 5.4 ) at 6 months , but not at 12 months .

       " ' WARCEF randomized 2,305 patients in sinus rhythm with ejection fraction ( EF ) 35 % to warfarin ( INR 2.0-3 .5 ) or aspirin 325 mg . Warfarin reduced the incident ischemic stroke ( IIS ) hazard rate by 48 % over aspirin in a secondary analysis . The IIS rate in heart failure ( HF ) is too low to warrant routine anticoagulation but epidemiologic studies show that prior stroke increases the stroke risk in HF . In this study , we explore IIS rates in WARCEF patients with and without baseline stroke to look for risk factors for IIS and determine if a subgroup with an IIS rate high enough to give a clinically relevant stroke risk reduction can be identified . We compared potential stroke risk factors between patients with baseline stroke and those without using the exact conditional score test for Poisson variables . We looked for risk factors for IIS , by comparing IIS rates between different risk factors . For EF we tried cut-off points of 10 , 15 and 20 % . The cut-off point 15 % was used as it was the highest EF that was associated with a significant increase in IIS rate . IIS and EF strata were balanced as to warfarin/aspirin assignment by the stratified randomized design . A multiple Poisson regression examined the simultaneous effects of all risk factors on IIS rate . IIS rates per hundred patient years ( / 100 PY ) were calculated in patient groups with significant risk factors . Missing values were assigned the modal value . Twenty of 248 ( 8.1 % ) patients with baseline stroke and 64 of 2,048 ( 3.1 % ) without had IIS . IIS rate in patients with baseline stroke ( 2.37 / 100 PY ) was greater than patients without ( 0.89 / 100 PY ) ( rate ratio 2.68 , p < 0.001 ) . Fourteen of 219 ( 6.4 % ) patients with ejection fraction ( EF ) < 15 % and 70 of 2,079 ( 3.4 % ) with EF 15 % had IIS . In the multiple regression analysis stroke at baseline ( p < 0.001 ) and EF < 15 % vs. 15 % ( p = 0.005 ) remained significant predictors of IIS . IIS rate was 2.04 / 100 PY in patients with EF < 15 % and 0.95 / 100 PY in patients with EF 15 % ( p = 0.009 ) . IIS rate in patients with baseline stroke and reduced EF was 5.88 / 100 PY with EF < 15 % decreasing to 2.62 / 100 PY with EF < 30 % . In a WARCEF exploratory analysis , prior stroke and EF < 15 % were risk factors for IIS . Further research is needed to determine if a clinically relevant stroke risk reduction is obtainable with warfarin in HF patients with prior stroke and reduced EF .',\n",
       " ' High intake of added sweeteners is considered to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disorders . Especially , high-fructose intake is regarded as potentially harmful to cardiometabolic health . It may cause not only weight gain but also low-grade inflammation , which represents an independent risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease . In particular , fructose has been suggested to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) expression in the liver and to increase circulating inflammatory cytokines . We therefore aimed to investigate , whether high-fructose diet has an impact on PAI-1 , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , e-selectin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentrations in healthy humans . We studied 20 participants ( 12 males and 8 females ) of the TUebingen FRuctose Or Glucose study . This is an exploratory , parallel , prospective , randomized , single-blinded , outpatient , hypercaloric , intervention study . The participants had a mean age of 30.9 2.1 years and a mean body mass index of 26.0 0.5 kg/m ( 2 ) and they received 150 g of either fructose or glucose per day for 4 weeks . There were neither significant changes of PAI-1 , MCP-1 , e-selectin and CRP after fructose ( n = 10 ) and glucose ( n = 10 ) intervention nor treatment effects ( all P > 0.2 ) . Moreover , we did not observe longitudinal associations of the inflammatory parameters with triglycerides , liver fat , visceral fat and body weight in the fructose group . Temporary high-fructose intake does not seem to cause inflammation in apparently healthy people in this secondary analysis of a small feeding trial .',\n",
       " ' Studies have demonstrated that plasmakinetic enucleation of the prostate ( PKEP ) and open prostatectomy ( OP ) have equivalent short-term efficacy for large prostates , but no comparison concerning their long-term results was reported . To demonstrate the noninferiority of PKEP to OP concerning maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) at 1 yr postoperatively and to compare the long-term results of both procedures . From 2004 to 2007 , 160 patients with prostates > 100g were randomized to receive PKEP or OP . A total of 153 patients ( 95.6 % ) completed the noninferiority study , and 123 patients ( 76.9 % ) finished a 6-yr follow-up assessment . The PKEP procedures were performed with 27F Karl Storz continuous flow resectoscopy and the Gyrus PlasmaKinetic device . OP was performed by a suprapubic transvesical approach . The primary end point was Qmax at 1 yr postoperatively . Secondary end points included other perioperative parameters and postoperative micturition variables . The student t test , Mann-Whitney U test , chi-square test , or Fisher exact probability test was used as appropriate . PKEP was noninferior to OP regarding Qmax at 1 yr postoperatively . Compared with OP , PKEP was associated with less perioperative hemoglobin decrease , shorter catheterization time , and shorter postoperative hospital stay ( 1.0 vs 3.2 g/dl , 40 vs 148h , and 3 vs 8 d , respectively ; p < 0.001 for all ) , as well as fewer short-term complications ( 22.5 % vs 42.5 % , p = 0.031 ) . On intention-to-treat analysis , both the PKEP and OP groups had equivalent Qmax ( 25.27.0 ml/s vs 25.77.6 ml/s , respectively ; p = 0.688 ) , International Prostate Symptom Score ( 3.5 [ 2-5 ] vs 3 [ 2-5 ] , respectively p = 0.755 ) , quality of life ( 2 [ 1-3 ] vs 2 [ 1-3 ] , respectively ; p = 0.950 ) , and postvoid residual urine ( 20 [ 9-33 .5 ] vs 16.5 [ 7-31 ] ml , respectively ; p = 0.469 ) at 72 mo postoperatively . No patients required reoperation because of recurrence of BPH . The relatively small sample size is the limitation . PKEP is a durable procedure with short - to long-term micturition improvement equivalent to OP and significantly lower perioperative morbidity . We compared PKEP with OP for large prostates and found that PKEP is less invasive , with short - to long-term micturition improvement equivalent to OP .

Follow-up study of children ( ages 5-10 ) of women enrolled in a multicenter trial of treatment versus no treatment of mild GDM . Height , weight , blood pressure , waist circumference , fasting glucose , fasting insulin , triglycerides , and HDL cholesterol were measured . Five hundred of 905 eligible offspring ( 55 % ) were enrolled . Maternal baseline characteristics were similar between the follow-up treated and untreated groups . The frequencies of BMI 95th ( 20.8 % and 22.9 % ) and 85th ( 32.6 % and 38.6 % ) percentiles were not significantly different in treated versus untreated offspring ( P = 0.69 and P = 0.26 ) . No associations were observed for BMI z score , log waist circumference , log triglycerides , HDL cholesterol , blood pressure , or log HOMA-estimated insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) . The effect of treatment was different by sex for fasting glucose and log HOMA-IR ( P for interaction = 0.002 and 0.02 , respectively ) but not by age-group ( 5-6 and 7-10 years ) for any outcomes . Female offspring of treated women had significantly lower fasting glucose levels . Although treatment for mild GDM has been associated with neonatal benefits , no reduction in childhood obesity or metabolic dysfunction in the offspring of treated women was found . However , only female offspring of women treated for mild GDM had lower fasting glucose .',\n",
       " \" To evaluate the long-term effects of an illicit drug use prevention program for adolescents that integrates life skills into the theory of planned behavior . We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in which 24 participating schools were randomized to either an intervention group ( 12 schools , n = 1,176 students ) or a control group ( 12schools , n = 915 students ) . Participants were grade 7 students . The intervention comprised a main intervention of 10 sessions and two booster interventions . Booster 1 ( four sessions ) and booster 2 ( two sessions ) were performed at 6months and 12months , respectively , after completion of the main intervention . Assessments were made at baseline , after the main intervention , and after each booster session using specific questionnaires for measuring participants ' attitudes , subjective norms , perceived behavioral control , and life skills . Retention rates were 71.9 % ( 845/1 ,176 ) in the intervention group and 90.7 % ( 830/915 ) in the control group after the 12-month follow-up . A significantly lower proportion of intervention group participants reported illicit drug use after the first and second booster sessions compared with control group participants ( .1 % vs. 1.7 % and .2 % vs. 1.7 % , respectively ; both p < .05 ) . Attitudes , subjective norms , perceived behavioral control , life skills , and behavioral intention scores of theintervention group were significantly higher than those of control group after the first and second booster sessions ( all p < .001 ) , suggesting that intervention group students tended to avoid drug use . A drug use prevention program integrating life skills into the theory of planned behavior may be effective for reducing illicit drug use and improving planned behavior-related constructs in adolescents .\",\n",

Sixty patients were randomized into an observation group and a control group , 30 cases in each one . In the control group , the conventional acupuncture was applied to Taixi ( KI 3 ) , Zhaohai ( KI 6 ) , Tinggong ( SI 19 ) and Waiguan ( TE 5 ) , etc. and the needles were retained for 30 min . In the observation group , on the basic treatment as the control group , Zhuang medicine acupuncture at Qineihuan point was added . The treatment was given once every day , 10 treatments made one session and there were 2 days of interval between the sessions . In 3 sessions of treatment , the changes of tinnitus were observed and the clinical efficacy was evaluated . After treatment , tinnitus score and tinnitus grade were all improved as compared with those before treatment in the two groups ( all P < 0.05 ) and the results in the observation group were better than those in the control group ( all P < 0.05 ) . The curative and remarkably effective rate was 63.3 % ( 19/30 ) and the total effective rate was 93.3 % ( 28/30 ) in the observation group , better than 30.0 % ( 9/30 ) and 73.3 % ( 22/30 ) in the control group ( both P < 0.05 ) .

We evaluated the relation between its circulating concentration , host response , appropriateness of antibiotic therapy , and mortality in patients with severe sepsis . Plasma presepsin was measured 1 , 2 , and 7 days after enrollment of 997 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in the multicenter Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis ( ALBIOS ) trial . They were randomized to albumin or crystalloids . We tested with univariate and adjusted models the association of single measurements of presepsin or changes over time with clinical events , organ dysfunctions , appropriateness of antibiotic therapy , and ICU or 90-day mortality . Presepsin concentration at baseline ( 946 [ 492-1 ,887 ] ng/L ) increased with the SOFA score , the number of prevalent organ dysfunctions or failures , and the incidence of new failures of the respiratory , coagulation , liver , and kidney systems . The concentration decreased in ICU over 7 days in patients with negative blood cultures , and in those with positive blood cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy ; it increased with inappropriate antibiotic therapy ( p = 0.0009 ) . Baseline presepsin was independently associated with , and correctly reclassified , the risk of ICU and 90-day mortality . Increasing concentrations of presepsin from day 1 to day 2 predicted higher ICU and 90-day mortality ( adjusted p < 0.0001 and 0.01 , respectively ) . Albumin had no effect on presepsin concentration . Presepsin is an early predictor of host response and mortality in septic patients . Changes in concentrations over time seem to reflect the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy .',\n",
       " ' The methacholine challenge test quantifies airway hyper-responsiveness , which is measured by the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20 % decrease in forced expiration volume in 1 second ( PC20 ) . The dose-response effect of inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) on PC20 has been inconsistent and within-patient variability of PC20 is not well established . To determine the effect of high - vs low-dose ICS on PC20 and within-patient variability in those with repeated measurements of PC20 . A randomized , double-masked , crossover trial was conducted in patients with asthma on controller medications with PC20 of 8 mg/mL or lower ( n = 64 ) to evaluate the effect of high-dose ( 1,000 g/d ) vs low-dose ( 250 g/d ) fluticasone for 4 weeks on PC20 . In addition , the variability of PC20 was assessed in participants who underwent 2 or 3 PC20 measurements on the same dose of ICS ( n = 27 ) over a 4-week interval . Because there was a significant period effect , dose comparison of the change in PC20 was assessed in the first treatment period . There was no significant difference in the change in PC20 for high - vs low-dose ICS ( 39 % vs 30 % increase , respectively ; P = .87 ) . The within - and between-participant variances for log PC20 were 0.84 and 0.96 , respectively , with an intra-class correlation of 0.53 , and 37 % of participants had more than 2 doubling dose changes in PC20 in those with repeated measurements . The effect of ICS on PC20 is not dose dependent at fluticasone levels of 250 and 1,000 g/d . Interpersonal variability for PC20 is large . A lack of precise measurements should be taken into account when interpreting any change in PC20 .',\n",
       " ' Selenium supplementation for women infected with HIV may increase genital shedding of HIV-1 , however , to our knowledge , no studies have examined the effect on viral shedding in breast milk . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of selenium supplementation on HIV-1 RNA detection in breast milk of HIV-infected women . HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled at 12 to 27 wk gestation in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of daily selenium ( 200 g as selenomethionine ) had cell-free HIV-1 RNA quantified in breast milk at 4 to 9 wk postpartum . All participants received high-dose multivitamins containing vitamin B complex , C , and E as standard of care . The proportion of women with detectable ( > 50 copies/mL ) HIV-1 RNA in breast milk appeared to be increased in the selenium group ( 36.4 % ) compared with those in the placebo group ( 27.5 % ) among the total cohort ( N = 420 ) , but results were borderline statistically significant ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.32 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.00-1 .76 ; P = 0.05 ) . In secondary analyses , the proportion of women with detectable HIV-1 RNA in breast milk was significantly greater in the selenium group ( 37.8 % ) compared with placebo group ( 27.5 % ) among women who did not receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ; RR , 1.37 ; 95 % CI , 1.03-1 .82 ; P = 0.03 ) . This relationship was primarily due to a significant effect of selenium among primiparous women ( RR , 2.24 ; 95 % CI , 1.30-3 .86 ; P < 0.01 ) , but not multiparous women ( RR , 1.14 ; 95 % CI , 0.81-1 .59 ; P = 0.54 ) ( P-value for interaction = 0.02 ) . Too few women received HAART in this study ( n = 12 ) to establish the effect of selenium supplementation . Selenium supplementation appears to increase HIV-1 RNA detection in breast milk among primiparous women not receiving HAART . Safety studies among pregnant women on HAART need to be conducted before administering selenium-containing supplements .',\n",

The expectation of this study is that shorter duration of plaster cast immobilisation is beneficial for the patient with a distal radius fracture . This risk of specific complications is low and generally similar in both treatment options . Moreover , the burden of the study is not much higher compared to standard treatment . Follow-up is standardized according to current trauma guidelines . Literature indicates that both treatment options from the study are accepted for displaced distal radius fractures . No clear advantage for one treatment options is found at present in the literature , although there is no level I evidence present .

A topical formulation of 0.1 % diclofenac was administered 4 times/d for 7 days to 4 cats , and artificial tear ( control ) solution was administered to the other 4 cats . After a 12-day washout period , cats received the other treatment . Ophthalmic examinations were performed daily . Plasma samples were obtained on days 1 and 7 for pharmacokinetic analysis . A CBC , serum biochemical analysis , urinalysis , determination of urine protein-to-creatinine ratio , and determination of glomerular filtration rate were performed before the start of the study and after each 7-day treatment period . Mild conjunctival hyperemia was the only adverse ocular effect detected . Maximal drug concentration and area under the curve were significantly higher on day 7 than on day 1 . Diclofenac-treated cats had a significantly lower glomerular filtration rate than did control-treated cats after the second but not after the first treatment period , presumably associated with iatrogenic hypovolemia . Topical ophthalmic administration of 0.1 % diclofenac was well tolerated in healthy cats , with only mild signs of ocular irritation . Detectable systemic concentrations of diclofenac were achieved with accumulation over 7 days . Systemic absorption of diclofenac may be associated with reduced glomerular filtration rate , particularly in volume-contracted animals . Topical ophthalmic 0.1 % diclofenac should be used with caution in volume-contracted or systemically ill cats .',\n",

Self-report measures were the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) and Rand 36-Item Health Survey ( RAND-36 ) . Performance-based measures included lower extremity strength , walking speed and endurance , and gait laboratory assessment . Ten Control and 11 Intervention subjects with an average age of 53.4 ( SD9 .3 ) years were randomized . All Intervention subjects completed the program without adverse effects . Although no statistically significantly results were reported , four months postoperatively , Intervention subjects had clinically important differences ( CID ) in strength compared with Control subjects . Walking endurance , WOMAC and RAND scores improved significantly with no CID noted between groups . Ten ( 48 % ) subjects reported a ceiling effect on the WOMAC ( 9 ( 43 % ) subjects on Pain ; 1 ( 5 % ) subject on Function ) . No group CID were noted in gait measures . Our recommendations would be that performance-based strength measures should be considered for the primary outcome in this younger cohort . Because of the ceiling effects with WOMAC Pain , a different pain measure is indicated . Other more challenging functional performance-based tests should be considered such as a more prolonged endurance test . There is merit in one-year follow-up as strength improved after four months in both groups .',\n",
       " ' Long-term complications of cystic fibrosis include osteoporosis and fragility fractures , but few data are available about effective treatment strategies , especially in young patients . We investigated treatment of low bone mineral density in children , adolescents , and young adults with cystic fibrosis . We did a multicentre trial in two phases . We enrolled patients aged 5-30 years with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density , from ten cystic fibrosis regional centres in Italy . The first phase was an open-label , 12-month observational study of the effect of adequate calcium intake plus calcifediol . The second phase was a 12-month , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , parallel group study of the efficacy and safety of oral alendronate in patients whose bone mineral apparent density had not increased by 5 % or more by the end of the observational phase . Patients were randomly assigned to either alendronate or placebo . Both patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment . We used dual x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and every 6 months thereafter , corrected for body size , to assess lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density . We assessed bone turnover markers and other laboratory parameters every 3-6 months . The primary endpoint was mean increase of lumbar spine bone mineral apparent density , assessed in the intention-to-treat population . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01812551 . We screened 540 patients and enrolled 171 ( mean age 138 years , SD 59 , range 5-30 ) . In the observational phase , treatment with calcium and calcifediol increased bone mineral apparent density by 5 % or more in 43 patients ( 25 % ) . 128 patients entered the randomised phase . Bone mineral apparent density increased by 163 % in the alendronate group ( n = 65 ) versus 31 % in the placebo group ( n = 63 ; p = 00010 ) . 19 of 57 young people ( 333 % ) receiving alendronate attained a normal-for-age bone mineral apparent density Z score . In the observational phase , five patients had moderate episodes of hypercalciuria , which resolved after short interruption of calcifediol treatment . During the randomised phase , one patient taking alendronate had mild fever versus none in the placebo group ; treatment groups did not differ significantly for other adverse events . Correct calcium intake plus calcifediol can improve bone mineral density in some young patients with cystic fibrosis . In those who do not respond to calcium and calcifediol alone , alendronate can safely and effectively increase bone mineral density . Telethon Foundation ( Italy ) .',\n",
       " ' The optimal crystalloid solution to use perioperatively in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy remains unclear . Many of the fluids used for intravenous hydration contain supraphysiologic concentrations of chloride , which can induce hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis , resulting in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal function . In addition , patients receiving less fluid and less sodium show faster recovery of gastrointestinal ( GI ) function after colonic surgery . This is an investigator-initiated , single-center , randomized , controlled , parallel group trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment , in the Department of Urology , University Hospital Bern , Switzerland . The study will involve 44 patients with bladder cancer scheduled for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion . The primary outcome is the duration between the end of surgery and the return of the GI function ( first defecation ) . Secondary outcomes are fluid balance ( body weight difference postoperatively versus preoperatively ) and the incidence of kidney function disorders according to the Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End Stage Renal Disease ( RIFLE classification ) . An equal number of patients are allocated to receive Ringerfundin solution or a glucose/potassium-based balanced crystalloid solution as baseline infusion during the entire time that intravenous administration of fluid is necessary during the perioperative period .

       " ' To determine clinical and demographic characteristics associated with antimuscarinic treatment response using a regression model . Adults with overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms for > 3 months and 1 urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ) episode and 8 micturitions per 24 hours at baseline were randomized to fesoterodine ( 8 mg ) , tolterodine extended-release ( 4 mg ) , or placebo in two 12-week , double-blind , head-to-head studies . Fesoterodine-treated patients received 4 mg/d during the first week and 8 mg/d thereafter . Patients completed 3-day bladder diaries and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire at baseline and week 12 . Pooled data for changes from baseline to week 12 in winsorized UUI episodes , micturitions , and urgency episodes per 24 hours and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Bother and health-related quality of life scores were analyzed posthoc using a regression model that selects outcome predictors from baseline values and patient characteristics while retaining baseline values and treatment , with stepwise inclusion of significant covariates and assessment of treatment interactions . Logistic regression was used for analysis of diary-dry rates . Younger age , lack of previous antimuscarinic treatment , shorter duration of OAB diagnosis , and female gender were common predictors of larger changes in outcomes from baseline to week 12 . Baseline measures often interacted with treatment , such that poorer baseline outcomes were predictive of larger treatment differences . Longer duration since OAB diagnosis predicted greater treatment differences for UUI episodes and in diary-dry rate , and increased age predicted greater treatment differences for micturitions . Symptom severity and duration , age , gender , and previous antimuscarinic pharmacotherapy impact the response to antimuscarinic treatment .',\n",

       " ' Studies suggest that smokers present more or greater numbers of potential periodontal pathogens than non-smokers . The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic effects of adjunctive aPDT on nonsurgical periodontal treatment in smokers with chronic periodontitis ( CP ) . Twenty smokers with CP had two contralateral teeth randomly assigned in a split-mouth design to receive SRP ( CG ) or SRP + a single episode of aPDT ( TG ) , with a diode laser and a phenothiazine photosensitizer . Levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization at baseline and 1 , 4 and 12 weeks after periodontal treatment . All 40 bacterial species evaluated were detected in different levels at baseline , with no statistic significant differences between groups . After periodontal treatment , the levels of some bacterial species decreased , while some other species presented an increase . Despite this variation , the statistical analysis was not able to identify significant differences neither at intragroup nor at intergroup comparisons . Periodontal treatment with SRP or SRP + aPDT was not able to reduce levels of 40 subgingival species in smokers with CP . These outcomes indicate that smoking impairs periodontal healing after nonsurgical treatment even associated with aPDT .',\n",

This was a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised , multiple-ascending-dose , up-titration study . Male subjects received increasing oral doses of selexipag ( 400-1 ,800 g ; n = 12 ) or placebo ( n = 4 ) twice daily for 3 days each , using incremental steps of 200 g between each dose level . Standard safety and tolerability data were collected . Blood samples were taken to assess the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite ACT-333679 and possible effects on platelet aggregation . Dose levels of selexipag up to 1,600 g were well tolerated and this dose was identified as the maximum tolerated dose . Plasma exposure to ACT-333679 was approximately 4 times higher than that to selexipag . Steady-state conditions for both compounds were reached on day 3 of each dose level , and no accumulation of selexipag or ACT-333679 was observed . Based on the area under the curve and the maximum plasma concentration , the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and ACT-333679 were dose proportional . At the highest dose level , the geometric mean terminal half-life of selexipag and ACT-333679 was 1.4 and 8.7 h , respectively . The observed effects on platelet aggregation were variable without obvious drug - or dose-dependent pattern . Oral administration of increasing doses of selexipag was well tolerated .

A comparison of costs and outcomes was undertaken alongside a pilot cluster randomised control trial involving three trial arms : ( 1 ) captain-led and poster STI screening promotion ; ( 2 ) sexual health advisor-led and poster STI screening promotion and ( 3 ) poster-only STI screening promotion ( control/comparator ) . For all study arms , resource use and cost data were collected prospectively . There was considerable variation in uptake rates between clubs , but results were broadly comparable across study arms with 50 % of men accepting the screening offer in the captain-led arm , 67 % in the sexual health advisor-led arm and 61 % in the poster-only control arm . The overall costs associated with the intervention arms were similar . The average cost per player tested was comparable , with the average cost per player tested for the captain-led promotion estimated to be 88.99 compared with 88.33 for the sexual health advisor-led promotion and 81.87 for the poster-only ( control ) arm . Costs and outcomes were similar across intervention arms . The target sample size was not achieved , and we found a greater than anticipated variability between clubs in the acceptability of screening , which limited our ability to estimate acceptability for intervention arms . Further evidence is needed about the public health benefits associated with screening interventions in non-clinical settings so that their cost-effectiveness can be fully evaluated .',\n",

Seventy-five asthmatic children were randomly divided into a Chinese medication group ( 45 cases ) and a Western medication control group ( 30 cases ) . Patients in the Chinese medication group were treated with a series of established Chinese herbal formulas , whereas the Western medication control group received a leukotriene receptor antagonist and a bronchial relaxant . Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of interleukin ( IL ) -4 , cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 ( CysLTR1 ) , and interferon ( IFN ) - gamma in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after treatment . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the peripheral blood levels of IL-4 , leukotriene ( LTE ) -4 , and INF-gamma before and after treatment . After treatment , the mRNA expression levels of IL-4 and CysLTR1 were down-regulated ( P < 0.01 ) and the mRNA expression levels of IFN-gamma were up-regulated ( P < 0.05 ) in the Chinese medication and Western medication groups ; no significant difference was found between the two groups . In the Chinese medication group , IL-4 blood level was decreased and it was significantly different from that in the Western medication group ( P < 0.05 ) ; there was also a significant increase in IFN-gamma blood levels after treatment with Chinese medication ( P < 0.05 ) . There were no significant differences in LTE-4 blood levels between the two groups before and after treatment ( P > 0.05 ) .

An active lag was determined by the inability of the erectly seated subject to actively extend the involved knee in maximal dorsiflexion of the ankle to the same level as the normal knee held in maximal extension and ankle in maximal dorsiflexion , as seen by the levels of the toes . A passive lag was determined by placing the subject prone with the knees just past the edge of the table and determining the high position of the heel in a fully resting extension position compared to the heel on the normal side . For the sitting active lag test , the inter-rater reliability was ` good ' ( Kappa 0.792 , SE of kappa 0.115 , 95 % confidence interval ) . For the prone passive lag test , the inter-rater reliability was ` good ' ( Kappa 0.636 , SE of kappa 0.136 , 95 % confidence interval ) . The SAPLT may be incorporated as a simple yet effective test to determine the presence of a knee extension lag . It identifies the type of restraint , active , passive or both , and is suggestive of the most appropriate management .\",\n",
       " \" In a large cluster-randomized trial on the impact of a prediction model , presenting the calculated risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) on-screen ( assistive approach ) increased the administration of risk-dependent PONV prophylaxis by anaesthetists . This change in therapeutic decision-making did not improve the patient outcome ; that is , the incidence of PONV . The present study aimed to quantify the effects of adding a specific therapeutic recommendation to the predicted risk ( directive approach ) on PONV prophylaxis decision-making and the incidence of PONV . A prospective before-after study was conducted in 1483 elective surgical inpatients . The before-period included care-as-usual and the after-period included the directive risk-based ( intervention ) strategy . Risk-dependent effects on the administered number of prophylactic antiemetics and incidence of PONV were analysed by mixed-effects regression analysis . During the intervention period anaesthetists administered 0.5 [ 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) : 0.4-0 .6 ] more antiemetics for patients identified as being at greater risk of PONV . This directive approach led to a reduction in PONV [ odds ratio ( OR ) : 0.60 , 95 % CI : 0.43-0 .83 ] , with an even greater reduction in PONV in high-risk patients ( OR : 0.45 , 95 % CI : 0.28-0 .72 ) . Anaesthetists administered more prophylactic antiemetics when a directive approach was used for risk-tailored intervention compared with care-as-usual . In contrast to the previously studied assistive approach , the increase in PONV prophylaxis now resulted in a lower PONV incidence , particularly in high-risk patients . When one aims for a truly ` PONV-free hospital ' , a more liberal use of prophylactic antiemetics must be accepted and lower-risk thresholds should be set for the actionable recommendations .\",\n",
       " ' Several field triage systems have been developed to rapidly sort patients following a mass casualty incident ( MCI ) . JumpSTART ( Simple Triage and Rapid Transport ) is a pediatric-specific MCI triage system . SALT ( Sort , Assess , Lifesaving interventions , Treat/Transport ) has been proposed as a new national standard for MCI triage for both adult and pediatric patients , but it has not been tested in a pediatric population . This pilot study hypothesizes that SALT is at least as good as JumpSTART in triage accuracy , speed , and ease of use in a simulated pediatric MCI . Paramedics were invited and randomly assigned to either SALT or JumpSTART study groups . Following randomization , subjects viewed a 15-minute PowerPoint lecture on either JumpSTART or SALT . Subjects were provided with a triage algorithm card for reference and were asked to assign triage categories to 10 pediatric patients in a simulated building collapse . The scenario consisted of 4 children in moulage and 6 high-fidelity pediatric simulators . Injuries and triage categories were based on a previously published MCI scenario . One investigator followed each subject to record time and triage assignment . All subjects completed a post-test survey and structured interview following the simulated disaster . Forty-three paramedics were enrolled . Seventeen were assigned to the SALT group with an overall triage accuracy of 66 % 15 % , an overtriage mean rate of 22 16 % , and an undertriage rate of 10 9 % . Twenty-six participants were assigned to the JumpSTART group with an overall accuracy of 66 12 % , an overtriage mean of 23 16 % , and an undertriage rate of 11.2 11 % . Ease of use was not statistically different between the two systems ( median Likert value of both systems = 2 , p = 0.39 ) Time to triage per patient was statistically faster in the JumpSTART group ( SALT = 34 23 seconds , JumpSTART = 26 19 seconds , p = 0.02 ) . Both systems were prone to cognitive and affective error . SALT appears to be at least as good as JumpSTART in overall triage accuracy , overtriage , or undertriage rates in a simulated pediatric MCI . Both systems were considered easy to use . However , JumpSTART was 8 seconds faster per patient in time taken to assign triage designations .',\n",
       " ' To explore the clinical efficacy and effect mechanism on chronic urticaria treated with moving cupping therapy combined with autohemotherapy with acupaint injection for desensitization at acupoints . One hundred and four patients of chronic urticaria were randomized into a comprehensive therapy group and a medication group , 52 cases in each one . In the comprehensive therapy group , the moving cupping therapy along the governor vessel and bladder meridian of foot-taiyang was applied combined with autohemotherapy with acupaint injection for desensitization at acupoints . The self-venous blood was injected at bilateral Quchi ( LI 11 ) and Zusanli ( ST 36 ) , 1 mL at each acupoint , once every 3 days . In the medication group , cetirizine tablets , 10 mg were prescribed for oral administration , once every day , and the compound dexamethasone acetate cream was used externally , once to twice a day . The clinical efficacy : was observed in 30 days of treatment in the two groups . The changes of serum interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) and immunoglobulin E ( Ig E ) before and after treatment were observed . The recurrence rate was compared between the two groups in 3 months after treatment . The cured and markedly effective rate was 90.4 % ( 47/52 ) in the comprehensive therapy group , which was higher obviously than 78.8 % ( 41/52 , P < 0.05 ) in the medication group . The levels of serum IL-4 and IgE were reduced in the patients of the two groups , indicating the significant difference in comparison before and after treatment ( all P < 0.01 ) and the reducing degree in the comprehensive therapy group was much more significant than that in the medicine group ( both P < 0.01 ) . The recurrence rate was 19.1 % ( 9/47 ) in the comprehensive therapy group in the 3-month follow-up after treatment , and apparently lower than 51.2 % ( 21/41 , P < 0.01 ) . The moving cupping therapy combined with autohemotherapy with acupaint injection for desensitization at acupoints achieves the better efficacy on chronic urticaria compared with the routine western medicine treatment and the recurrence rate is low . The effect mechanism is possibly related to the down-regulation of serum IL-4 and IgE in the patients .',\n",

Preoperative dexamethasone was associated with a higher rate of distant recurrence in patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer . Given the small sample size , this finding should be interpreted with caution , but warrants further investigation in a prospective study .',\n",
       " \" The EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool ( EXACT ) is a patient-reported outcome measure to standardize the symptomatic assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations , including reported and unreported events . The instrument has been validated in a short-term study of patients with acute exacerbation and stable disease ; its performance in longer-term studies has not been assessed . To test the EXACT 's performance in three randomized controlled trials and describe the relationship between resource-defined medically treated exacerbations ( MTEs ) and symptom ( EXACT ) - defined events . Prespecified secondary analyses of data from phase II randomized controlled trials testing new drugs for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease : one 6-month trial ( United States ) ( n = 235 ) and two 3-month , multinational trials ( AZ 1 [ n = 749 ] , AZ 2 [ n = 597 ] ) . In each case , the experimental drugs were found to be ineffective , permitting assessment of the EXACT 's performance in three independent studies of moderate to severe high-risk patients on maintenance therapies . The mean age of subjects was 62 to 64 years ; 48 to 76 % were male . Mean FEV1 % predicted was 42 to 59 % . EXACT scores exhibited internal consistency ( Cronbach 's 0.90 ) , reproducibility ( intraclass correlation 0.70 ) , correlation with St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( Spearman rho [ rs ] = 0.62 , 0.46 , 0.46 in the three trials ; P < 0.001 ) , and Breathlessness Cough and Sputum Scale ( AZ 1 , rs = 0.83 ; AZ 2 , rs = 0.83 ; P < 0.001 ) . EXACT-defined events had a high correspondence with alternative indicators of worsening ( 94 , 88 , and 93 % ) . In each trial , unreported events were similar in severity ( mean EXACT score , 56 , 57 , 61 vs. 53 , 54 [ P < 0.05 ] , 57 [ P < 0.05 ] , respectively ; 100-point scale ) and longer ( median , 9 , 8 , 7 vs. 8 , 7 [ P < 0.01 ] , 6 days , respectively ) than moderate MTEs .

       " ' Complex regional pain syndrome is multifactorial . Exaggerated inflammatory responses to limb injury may be involved . The authors hypothesized that capsaicin-induced pain and neurogenic inflammation ( skin perfusion and flare area ) are increased in patients with complex regional pain syndrome compared with that in controls . Twenty patients with unilateral upper-limb complex regional pain syndrome and 20 age - , sex - , and body mass index-matched controls participated . Topical capsaicin 5 % was applied to the back of both hands for 30 min , and pain intensity was assessed on a visual analogue scale . A laser Doppler perfusion imager scanner estimated capsaicin-induced skin perfusion and flare area . Autonomic and small-fiber function was assessed by sensory testing , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , and vasoconstrictor responses . The authors found bilateral hypersensitivity to capsaicin ( P 0.02 ) , skin fold ( P = 0.001 ) , joint pressure ( P < 0.0001 ) , cold ( P 0.01 ) , and heat pain ( P 0.04 ) in patients compared with that in controls and thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in the complex regional pain syndrome-affected hand compared with that in the unaffected hand ( P 0.001 ) . The patients had normal capsaicin-induced flare areas , thermal detection thresholds , quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , and vasoconstrictor responses . The main finding is bilaterally increased capsaicin-induced pain in patients compared with controls . The flare response to capsaicin was normal , suggesting that the increased pain response was not due to increased neurogenic inflammation . The bilateral hypersensitivity to painful chemical , thermal , and mechanical stimuli not confined to the innervation area of a peripheral nerve or root can not be explained by a regional change and may partly be due to central sensitization .',\n",
       " ' Diurnal variation in serum growth hormone ( s-GH ) levels after exogenous GH delivery has previously been reported in patients with no endogenous GH secretion . Changes in postural position or physical activity , leading to changes in blood flow and/or lymphatic drainage may be underlying explanations . The primary aim of this study is to study a possible impact of exercise and supine rest on pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and day-to-day variation of subcutaneously ( s.c. ) administered GH in adult GH deficient ( AGHD ) patients . The secondary aim of this study is to compare s-IGF-I , s-insulin , and plasma ( p ) - glucose profiles after a carbohydrate rich breakfast following s.c. GH injection vs. continuous infusion . During supine rest eight AGHD males ( 59.88 years , BMI 29.74.9 kg/m ( 2 ) ) were treated with one daily s.c. GH injections of 3 mg/24 h for 48 h ( treatment sessions A , B ) or a continuous s.c. GH infusion of 3 mg/24 h for 60 h ( treatment sessions C , D ) . Exercise comprised 1 h bicycling with 50 W load on two consecutive days during treatment sessions B and D. Administration of GH as a bolus injection , but not as a continuous GH infusion , resulted in about 32 % higher s-GH levels during exercise ( 60 min ) as well as 30 min after ( s-GH logAUC ( B-A ) difference was 0.28 ; 95 % CI : 0.14-0 .4 ; p < 0.001 ) . However , the total s-GH ( AUC 0-24 h ) ( p = 0.75 ) and s-IGF-I ( AUC0-48 h ) levels ( p = 0.51 ) remained unchanged between the two occasions . P-glucose and insulin profiles were significantly higher after carbohydrate rich breakfast before first and second dosing both following s.c. GH injection and continuous infusion ( p < 0.05 ) . Moderate exercise intermittently increased s-GH levels . These changes seem to have no clinical short-term relevance , since total s-GH ( 24 h ) and s-IGF-I ( 48 h ) levels were unaffected .',\n",

Bilateral , sequential , simultaneous TKAs were performed in 80 patients ( 160 knees ) . There were 63 women and 17 men with a mean age of 54.3 years ( range 49-55 ) , who received a cementless prosthesis in one knee and a cemented prosthesis in the other . The mean follow-up was 16.6 years ( range 16-17 ) . At final review , the mean Knee Society ( KS ) knee scores ( 95.8 versus 96.9 ) , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities ( WOMAC ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) index ( 25.4 versus 25.9 ) , range of motion ( ROM ) ( 125 versus 128 ) , patient satisfaction ( 8.1 versus 8.3 ) and radiological results were similar in both groups . Femoral component survival rate was 100 % in both groups at 17 years ; at 17 years , the cemented tibial component survival rate was 100 % and the cementless tibial component 98.7 % . No osteolysis was identified in either group . Long-term results of both cementless and cemented TKAs were encouraging in patients with OA who were < 55 years .

       " ' To assess the relationship between session-by-session mediators and treatment outcomes in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and acceptance and commitment therapy ( ACT ) for social anxiety disorder . Session-by-session changes in negative cognitions ( a theorized mediator of CBT ) and experiential avoidance ( a theorized mediator of ACT ) were assessed in 50 adult outpatients randomized to CBT ( n = 25 ) or ACT ( n = 25 ) for DSM-IV social anxiety disorder . Multilevel modeling analyses revealed significant nonlinear decreases in the proposed mediators in both treatments , with ACT showing steeper decline than CBT at the beginning of treatment and CBT showing steeper decline than ACT at the end of treatment . Curvature ( or the nonlinear effect ) of experiential avoidance during treatment significantly mediated posttreatment social anxiety symptoms and anhedonic depression in ACT , but not in CBT , with steeper decline of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire at the beginning of treatment predicting fewer symptoms in ACT only . Curvature of negative cognitions during both treatments predicted outcome , with steeper decline of negative cognitions at the beginning of treatment predicting lower posttreatment social anxiety and depressive symptoms . Rate of change in negative cognitions at the beginning of treatment is an important predictor of change across both ACT and CBT , whereas rate of change in experiential avoidance at the beginning of treatment is a mechanism specific to ACT .',\n",
       " \" Although the benefits of physical activity ( PA ) on to prevent and manage non-communicable diseases are well known , strategies to help increase the levels of PA among different populations are limited . Exercise-referral schemes have emerged as one effective approach to promote PA ; however , there is uncertainty about the feasibility and effectiveness of these schemes in settings outside high-income countries . This study will examine the effectiveness of a scheme to refer hypertensive patients identified in Primary Health Care facilities ( PHCU ) of the Mexican social security institution to a group PA program offered in the same institution . We will describe the methods of a cluster randomized trial study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise referral scheme to increasing physical activity in hypertensive patients compared to a non-referral scheme . Four PHCU were selected for the study ; the PHCU will take part as the unit of randomization and sedentary hypertensive patients as the unit of assessment . 2 PHCU of control group ( GC ) will provide information to hypertensive patients about physical activity benefits and ways to increase it safely . 2 PHCU of intervention group ( IG ) will refer patients to sports facilities at the same institution , to follow a group-based PA program developed to increase the PA levels with a designed based on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory . To evaluate the effects of the intervention as well as short-term maintenance of the intervention 's effects , PA will be assessed at baseline , at 24 and 32 weeks of follow-up . The main outcome will be the difference before and after intervention in the percentage of participants meeting recommended levels of PA between and within intervention and control groups . PA will be measured through self-report and with objective measure by accelerometer . This study will allow us to evaluate a multidisciplinary effort to link the primary care and community-based areas of the same health care system . Our findings will provide important information about the feasibility and effectiveness of an exercise-referral scheme and will be useful for decision-making about the implementation of strategies for increasing PA among hypertensive and other clinical populations in Mexico and Latin America .

Acute exercise study : RA patients ( N = 12 , age : 5611 ) undertook a bout of exercise ( 30-40min , 70 % VO2MAX ) , and blood samples were taken before and after exercise to assess markers of oxidative stress . Training study : RA patients ( N = 19 , age : 5610 ) were randomised into either a control or exercise group , who undertook 3 exercise sessions per week ( 30-40min @ 70 % VO2MAX ) for 3months . Plasma markers of oxidative stress ( protein carbonyls ( PC ) , lipid hydroperoxides ( LOOH ) , 3-nitrotyrosine ( 3-NT ) , total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) and catalase ( CAT ) activity ) , inflammation ( interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ) and nitric oxide metabolites ( NOx ) were assessed before and after training . Acute exercise study : Protein carbonyls ( PC ) ( +18 % ) and NOx ( +27 % ) were significantly increased following exercise . Training study : 3-nitrotyrosine ( 3-NT ) decreased ( 2.181.78 to 1.100.93 M ) in the exercise group only , alongside increases in aerobic fitness ( 24.454.98 to 27.104.51 ml/kg/min ( -1 ) ) and reductions in disease activity score ( DAS : 3.471.17 to 2.880.76 ) .

The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a bidirectional and multi-user telerehabilitation system on balance and satisfaction in patients with chronic stroke living in long-term care facilities ( LTCFs ) . This pilot study used a multi-site , blocked randomization design . Twenty-four participants from three LTCFs were recruited , and the participants were randomly assigned into the telerehabilitation ( Tele ) and conventional therapy ( Conv ) groups within each LTCF . Tele group received telerehabilitation but the Conv group received conventional therapy with two persons in each group for three sessions per week and for four weeks . The outcome measures included Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , Barthel Index ( BI ) , and the telerehabilitation satisfaction of the participants . A telerehabilitation system included `` therapist end '' in a laboratory , and the `` client end '' in LTCFs . The conventional therapy was conducted in LTCFs . Training programs conducted for both the Tele and Conv groups showed significant effects within groups on the participant BBS as well as the total and self-care scores of BI . No significant difference between groups could be demonstrated . The satisfaction of participants between the Tele and the Conv groups also did not show significant difference . This pilot study indicated that the multi-user telerehabilitation program is feasible for improving the balance and functional activity similar to conventional therapy in patients with chronic stroke living in LTCFs .\",\n",
       " ' The reward value of food is partly dependent on learned associations . It is not yet known whether replacing sugar with non-caloric sweeteners in food is affecting long-term acceptance . To determine the effect of replacing sugar with non-caloric sweeteners in a nutrient-empty drink ( soft drink ) versus nutrient-rich drink ( yoghurt drink ) on reward value after repeated exposure . We used a randomized crossover design whereby forty subjects ( 15 men , 25 women ) with a mean SD age of 21 2 y and BMI of 21.5 1.7 kg/m ( 2 ) consumed a fixed portion of a non-caloric sweetened ( NS ) and sugar sweetened ( SS ) versions of either a soft drink or a yoghurt drink ( counterbalanced ) for breakfast which were distinguishable by means of colored labels . Each version of a drink was offered 10 times in semi-random order . Before and after conditioning the reward value of the drinks was assessed using behavioral tasks on wanting , liking , and expected satiety . In a subgroup ( n = 18 ) fMRI was performed to assess brain reward responses to the drinks . Outcomes of both the behavioral tasks and fMRI showed that conditioning did not affect the reward value of the NS and SS versions of the drinks significantly . Overall , subjects preferred the yoghurt drinks to the soft drinks and the ss drinks to the NS drinks . In addition , they expected the yoghurt drinks to be more satiating , they reduced hunger more , and delayed the first eating episode more . Conditioning did not influence these effects . Our study showed that repeated consumption of a non-caloric sweetened beverage , instead of a sugar sweetened version , appears not to result in changes in the reward value . It can not be ruled out that learned associations between sensory attributes and food satiating capacity which developed preceding the conditioning period , during lifetime , affected the reward value of the drinks .',\n",
       " ' We test the hypothesis that anesthesia , measured as pain scores , induced by a novel topical anesthetic putty is non-inferior ( margin = 1.3 ) to that provided by conventional lidocaine infiltration for the repair of lacerations . A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department ( ED ) of a local hospital . Participants were randomly allocated to receive either infiltration anesthesia or topical anesthetic putty as per the trial protocol . Pain scores were recorded 15 minutes after infiltration and 30 minutes after topical anesthetic putty application . Median pain scores were compared between groups . Wound evaluation scores were conducted after 7 to 10 days and adverse events were monitored for both groups of participants throughout the study . One hundred and ten participants were enrolled in the study , with 56 receiving infiltration and 54 receiving topical anesthetic putty . The median difference between the pain scores of the 2 groups was 0 ( 95 % confidence interval -1 to 0 ) . There were no substantial differences between the 2 groups in terms of either the wound evaluation scores or the incidence of adverse events . The novel topical anesthetic putty was not inferior to infiltration with lidocaine with respect to the pain experienced during suturing , and this putty is a feasible alternative to infiltration anesthesia of lacerations in the ED .',\n",

One hundred patients diagnosed with anal fistula undergoing surgery between March 2012 and March 2013 in our department were prospectively enrolled . All the patients were randomly divided into the ultrasound group and the control group with fifty patients in each group . The ultrasound group received 3D-EAUS and the control group received routine examinations ( digital examination and probe ) to assess the position of the internal opening , the type of fistula and secondary tracks , respectively . The concordance rate of the preoperative assessment and intraoperative exploration was evaluated between the two groups . The accuracy of identifying internal opening was 96.0 % for the ultrasound group and 82.0 % for the control group with statistically significant difference ( P = 0.02 ) . The accuracy of identifying internal opening for simple anal fistula was similar ( 95.0 % vs. 91.3 % , P = 1 ) . For complex anal fistula , the accuracy was also higher in the ultrasound group ( 96.7 % vs. 74.1 % , P = 0.025 ) . The accuracy of fistula classification was 78.0 % for the ultrasound group and 96.0 % for the control group with significant difference ( P = 0.01 ) . The accuracy of identifying a second track was higher in the ultrasound group ( 96.0 % vs. 82.0 % , P = 0.025 ) . It is significantly superior for 3D-EAUS to detect the internal opening , fistula classification and identification of a second track in complex anal fistulas as compared to conventional examination . 3D-EAUS should be recommended as a preoperative assessment for anal fistula , especially for complex one .',\n",

Therefore , we have evaluated the effect of a supervision program on the quality of integrated diabetes care in the Netherlands in the 2011-2012 period . In this cluster RCT , the supervision program was assigned to randomly selected care groups providing care to diabetes patients . The supervision program included announcements of inspections , site visits , and sending individualized reports . Indicators of effectiveness were derived from the structures , processes , and outcomes of care . These indicators were collected from patients ' files , before and after the supervision program . Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze data from 356 patients of 10 intervention and 8 control care groups . Structures and processes of care did not improve more in the intervention groups than in the control care groups . Moreover , health outcomes did not improve more in the intervention groups than in the control care groups . Although structures of care improved over time in the total population of intervention and control care groups , there were no changes in process of care or health outcomes . In this cluster RCT , we could not demonstrate improvements in quality of integrated diabetes care resulting from the supervision program . Although structures of care did improve over time , other quality-improvement initiatives are necessary to substantially strengthen integrated care for diabetes patients .\",\n",
       " ' Following a major burn , skeletal muscle protein synthesis rate increases but is often insufficient to compensate for massively elevated muscle protein breakdown rates . Given the long-term nature of the pathophysiologic response to burn injury , we hypothesized that muscle protein synthesis rate would be chronically elevated in severely burned children . The objectives of this study were to characterize muscle protein synthesis rate of burned children over a period of 24 months after injury and to identify predictors that influence this response . A total of 87 children with 40 % or greater total body surface area ( TBSA ) burned were included . Patients participated in stable isotope infusion studies at 1 , 2 , and approximately 4 weeks after burn and at 6 , 12 , and 24 months after injury to determine skeletal muscle protein fractional synthesis rate . Generalized estimating equations with log link normal distribution were applied to account for clustering of patients and control for patient characteristics . Patients ( 8 6 years ) had large ( 62 , 51-72 % TBSA ) and deep ( 47 % 21 % TBSA third degree ) burns . Muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was elevated throughout the first 12 months after burn compared with established values from healthy young adults . Muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was lower in boys , in children older than 3 years , and when burns were greater than 80 % TBSA . Muscle protein synthesis is elevated for at least 1 year after injury , suggesting that greater muscle protein turnover is a component of the long-term pathophysiologic response to burn trauma . Muscle protein synthesis is highly affected by sex , age , and burn size in severely burned children . These findings may explain the divergence in net protein balance and lean body mass in different populations of burn patients . Prognostic study , level III .',\n",

Long-term outcome of patients of 2 main participating hospitals in a prior multicenter randomized trial comparing clinical outcome of MBP versus no MBP was reviewed . Primary endpoint was cancer-related mortality and secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality . A total of 382 patients underwent potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer . One hundred seventy-seven ( 46 % ) patients were treated with MBP and 205 ( 54 % ) were not before surgery . Median follow-up was 7.6 years ( mean 6.6 , range .01 to 12.73 ) .

       " ' Isoflavones are present in soy foods and soy-based supplements . Despite low plasma isoflavone concentrations in the general Western population , concentrations in supplement users exceed those suggested to be beneficial for health in Asian populations , raising concerns for adverse effects . To aid risk assessment , quantification of the relation between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations is essential . Plasma samples were collected from postmenopausal women in three placebo-controlled crossover studies with 8-week periods for supplements ( two studies , ~ 100mg isoflavones/day , n = 88 ) or 4-week periods for soy foods ( one study , ~ 48mg isoflavones/day , n = 15 ) . Plasma isoflavone concentrations ( daidzein , equol , genistein and glycitein ) were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection . The association between plasma concentrations and isoflavone intake , equol producer status , intake-producer interaction and background dietary intake was assessed based on the assumption of a log-linear relation . Median plasma total isoflavone concentrations after the soy food and supplement interventions were respectively 2.16 and 3.47 mol/l for equol producers and 1.30 and 2.39 mol/l for non-producers . Regression analysis showed that doubling isoflavone intake increased plasma concentrations by 55-62 % ( s.e. 1-2 % , R ( 2 ) > 0.87 ) for daidzein , genistein , equol ( only for producers ) and total isoflavones ; for glycitein the association was weaker ( 151 % , R ( 2 ) = 0.48 ) . Adjustments for energy , carbohydrate and fat intake did not affect these estimates . Inter-individual variation , estimated based on repeated measures in one of the studies , was 30-96 % . Although the relation between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations was adequately quantified , the use of isoflavone intake data for risk assessment needs caution due to large inter-individual variation in plasma concentrations .',\n",
       " ' The simultaneous presence of cancer and other medical conditions ( comorbidity ) is frequent . Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for as well head and neck cancer ( HNC ) and lung cancer ( LC ) as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . COPD is the most common comorbidity in LC patients , and presence of COPD worsens the prognosis of HNC and LC . COPD is under-diagnosed and under-treated in the Danish population . The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of COPD in a HNC and LC population , and to determine the need and feasibility of a randomized controlled phase II trial comparing usual care with optimized medical treatment of COPD in cancer patients . All patients with HNC or LC referred for oncologic treatment in a university hospital during a 10-month period were invited to attend a pulmonary clinic for evaluation of lung function . Patients who were found to have concomitant COPD were randomized to intervention or usual care . Primary endpoints were prevalence of COPD among the referred patients with either LC or HNC , and further whether the patients that were diagnosed with COPD already received treatment in accordance with Danish COPD guidelines . Secondary outcome was feasibility , i.e. the proportion of eligible patients that accepted follow-up in the pulmonary clinic for 24 weeks in addition to oncological treatment . The design of the randomized trail is described in detail . In total 130 patients of whom 65 % had LC and 35 % HNC have been screened during the first seven months of this ongoing trial . Sixty-eight percent of LC patients and 22 % of HNC patients had COPD . All but one of 68 eligible patients accepted randomization . Nearly one third ( 31 % ) of the LC and HNC patients with COPD were diagnosed prior to study entry , and of these , only 33 % were receiving correct treatment according to current guidelines . For patients with LC , and to a lesser extend HNC , there is a need for improved diagnosis and treatment of concomitant COPD . Furthermore , patients found it acceptable to be scheduled for a 24-week follow-up in a pulmonary clinic along with their oncological treatment .',\n",
       " \" Existing eye-tracking literature has shown that both adults and children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) show fewer and slower fixations on faces . Despite this reduced saliency and processing of other faces , recognition of their own face is reported to be more `` typical '' in nature . This study uses eye-tracking to explore the typicality of gaze patterns when children with ASD attend their own faces compared to other familiar and unfamiliar faces . Eye-tracking methodology was used to explore fixation duration and time taken to fixate on the Eye and Mouth regions of familiar , unfamiliar and Self Faces . Twenty-one children with ASD ( 9-16 years ) were compared to typically developing matched groups . There were no significant differences between children with ASD and typically matched groups for fixation patterns to the Eye and Mouth areas of all face types ( familiar , unfamiliar and self ) . Correlational analyses showed that attention to the Eye area of unfamiliar and Self Faces was related to socio-communicative ability in children with ASD . Levels of socio-communicative ability in children with ASD were related to gaze patterns on unfamiliar and Self Faces , but not familiar faces . This lack of relationship between ability and attention to familiar faces may indicate that children across the autism spectrum are able to fixate these faces in a similar way . The implications for these findings are discussed .\",\n",

During Cycles 2 , 3 and 4 , outpatient visits were performed to assess maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) , area under the curve ( AUC0 - ) and time to steady state as well as pharmacodynamics . These key PK parameters were calculated and compared within groups between baseline and treatment cycles . A total of 31 women enrolled and completed the study ( CC group , n = 16 ; ID group , n = 15 ) . Demographics were similar between groups [ mean BMI : CC , 38 kg/m ( 2 ) ( S.D. 5.1 ) ; ID , 41 kg/m ( 2 ) ( S.D. 7.6 ) ] . At baseline , the key LNG PK parameters were no different between groups ; average time to reach steady state was 12 days in both groups ; Cmax were CC : 3.821.28 ng/mL and ID : 3.130.87 ng/mL ; and AUC0 - were CC : 267115 h ng/mL and ID : 19975 h ng/mL . Following randomization , the CC group maintained steady-state serum levels whereas the ID group had a significantly higher Cmax ( p < .001 ) but again required 12 days to achieve steady state . However , AUC was not significantly different between CC ( 412255 h ng/mL ) and ID ( 283130 h ng/mL ) . Forty-five percent ( 14/31 ) of the study population had evidence of an active follicle-like structure prior to randomization and afterwards this decreased to 9 % ( 3/31 ) . Both increasing the OC dose and continuous dosing appear to counteract the impact of obesity on key OC PK parameters . Obesity adversely affects the pharmacokinetics of very low dose OC pills . Although the impact of these changes on OC efficacy is still under debate , PK parameters can be normalized in obese users by continuous dosing or increasing to a low-dose pill .',\n",

The purpose of the current study was to assess improvement in postural balance in PD patients following electroacupuncture ( EA ) as an alternative therapy . 15 aging adults ( 71.2 6.3 years ) with idiopathic PD and 44 healthy age-matched participants ( 74.6 6.5 years ) were recruited . The PD participants were randomly assigned ( at a ratio of 2:1 ) to an intervention ( n = 10 ) or to a control group ( n = 5 ) . The intervention group received a 30-min EA treatment on a weekly basis for 3 weeks , while the control group received a sham treatment . Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the final therapy . Measurements included balance assessment , specifically the ratio of medial-lateral ( ML ) center-of-gravity ( COG ) sway to anterior-posterior ( AP ) sway ( COGML/AP ) and ankle/hip sway during eyes-open , eyes-closed , and eyes-open dual-task trials , the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , as well as quality of life , concerns for fall , and pain questionnaires . No difference was observed for the assessed parameters between the intervention and the control group at baseline . After treatment , an improvement in balance performance was observed in the intervention group . Compared with the healthy population , PD patients prior to treatment had larger COGML/AP sway with more dependency on upper-body movements for maintaining balance . Following EA therapy , COGML/AP sway was reduced by 31 % and ankle/hip sway increased by 46 % in the different conditions ( p = 0.02 for the dual-task condition ) . The clinical rating revealed an overall improvement ( p < 0.01 ) in mentation , behavior , and mood ( UPDRS part I , 49 % ) , activities of daily living ( UPDRS part II , 46 % ) , and motor examination ( UPDRS part III , 40 % ) . There was a significant reduction ( p < 0.02 ) in the specific items regarding UPDRS fall status ( 67 % ) and rigidity ( 48 % ) . Changes were small and nonsignificant in the controls ( p > 0.29 ) . This pilot study demonstrates improvement in rigidity and balance following EA . These preliminary results suggest EA could be a promising alternative treatment for balance disturbance in PD .\",\n",
       " ' Smoking reduction remains a pivotal issue in public health policy , but quit rates obtained with traditional quit-smoking therapies remain disappointingly low . Tobacco Harm Reduction ( THR ) , aiming at less harmful ways of consuming nicotine , may provide a more effective alternative . One promising candidate for THR are electronic cigarettes ( e-cigs ) . The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of second-generation e-cigs both in terms of acute craving-reduction in the lab and in terms of smoking reduction and experienced benefits/complaints in an eight-month Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . RCT with three arms . Participants ( N = 48 ) unwilling to quit smoking were randomized into two e-cig groups and one control group . During three lab sessions ( over two months ) participants , who had been abstinent for four hours , vaped/smoked for five minutes , after which we monitored the effect on craving and withdrawal symptoms . eCO and saliva cotinine levels were also measured . In between lab sessions , participants in the e-cig groups could use e-cigs or smoke ad libitum , whereas the control group could only smoke . After the lab sessions , the control group also received an e-cig . The RCT included several questionnaires , which repeatedly monitored the effect of ad libitum e-cig use on the use of tobacco cigarettes and the experienced benefits/complaints up to six months after the last lab session . From the first lab session on , e-cig use after four hours of abstinence resulted in a reduction in cigarette craving which was of the same magnitude as when a cigarette was smoked , while eCO was unaffected . After two months , we observed that 34 % of the e-cig groups had stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes , versus 0 % of the control group . After five months , the e-cig groups demonstrated a total quit-rate of 37 % , whereas the control group showed a quit rate of 38 % three months after initiating e-cig use . At the end of the eight-month study , 19 % of the e-cig groups and 25 % of the control group were totally abstinent from smoking , while an overall reduction of 60 % in the number of cigarettes smoked per day was observed ( compared to intake ) . eCO levels decreased , whereas cotinine levels were the same in all groups at each moment of measurement . Reported benefits far outweighed the reported complaints . In a series of controlled lab sessions with e-cig nave tobacco smokers , second generation e-cigs were shown to be immediately and highly effective in reducing abstinence induced cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms , while not resulting in increases in eCO . Remarkable ( > 50 pc ) eight-month reductions in , or complete abstinence from tobacco smoking was achieved with the e-cig in almost half ( 44 % ) of the participants .',\n",
       " \" Improving nutrition and physical activity behaviors associated with childhood obesity are significant national public health goals . Energy Balance for Kids with Play ( EB4K with Play ) , developed through a partnership between the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation and Playworks , is a multi-component school-based intervention designed to address youth 's nutrition and physical activity behaviors . This article describes the EB4K with Play intervention and evaluation study and presents the baseline data . The evaluation is a 2-year cluster-randomized design targeting third - to fifth-grade students enrolled in a low-income , urban school district in northern California . Six schools were recruited to participate . Four were randomized to the intervention group and two into a control group . Baseline student-level data pertaining to nutrition , physical activity , fitness , and BMI were collected in the fall of 2011 . The EB4K with Play program , which includes direct-to-student nutrition and physical activity interventions , a school wellness component , and parent/community partner outreach components , began immediately after baseline data collection . An ethnically diverse sample of students ( n = 844 ) was recruited to participate in the study . Baseline data showed a higher percent of eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunch and higher rates of obesity/overweight than the California state averages . Fitness levels and levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were comparable to state averages . End-point data will be collected after 2 years of the intervention . The findings from this study should help guide future efforts to design effective intervention programs to support the prevention of pediatric obesity .\",\n",

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLNP/BPO 30 % topically applied once or twice daily vs. CLNP twice daily in Japanese patients with acne . Eight hundred patients were randomized to receive CLNP/BPO 30 % once daily , CLNP/BPO 30 % twice daily or CLNP twice daily for 12weeks . Primary endpoints were absolute change in number of total lesions ( TLs ) from baseline to week 12 to demonstrate the superiority of CLNP/BPO 30 % twice daily and noninferiority of CLNP/BPO 30 % once daily vs. CLNP twice daily . Secondary endpoints were absolute and percentage changes in TLs , inflammatory lesions ( ILs ) , noninflammatory lesions ( non-ILs ) and Investigator 's Static Global Assessment ( ISGA ) score . Safety assessments included adverse events ( AEs ) , laboratory tests , vital signs and local skin tolerability . Change in TL counts from baseline to week 12 for CLNP/BPO 30 % twice daily was superior to CLNP twice daily ( difference -110 ; P < 001 ) ; CLNP/BPO 30 % once daily was not inferior to CLNP twice daily ( difference -103 ; P < 001 ) . Absolute and percentage reductions in TL , IL and non-IL counts and ISGA score were greater for CLNP/BPO 30 % once or twice daily than for CLNP twice daily with significant differences seen from early on . Most AEs were mild or moderate . The incidence of adverse drug reactions was higher for CLNP/BPO 30 % once ( 240 % ) or twice ( 351 % ) daily than for CLNP twice daily ( 90 % ) . Compared with CLNP twice daily , CLNP/BPO 30 % once daily was more effective and CLNP/BPO 30 % twice daily at least as effective , with an early onset of action and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in Japanese patients .\",\n",

Dr. Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi . A randomized comparative clinical trial was performed in keratoconic eyes fitted with Rose-K ( Rose-K group ) and Soper ( Soper group ) contact lenses . Patients data were evaluated for best spectacle corrected visual acuity , best contact lens corrected visual acuity ( BCLCVA ) , corneal topography , glare acuity , contrast sensitivity , tear function tests and specular microscopy . Patients were also asked to complete a self-reported comfort questionnaire at each visit . Sixty eyes were randomized to the Rose-K and Soper groups . The two groups were comparable in all the baseline parameters . There was a statistically significant improvement in BCLCVA in both groups at 3 months ( P < 0.01 , both groups ) . The difference between in BCLCVA in both groups was not statistically significant . In both groups , there was a significant improvement in the comfort score at 3 months compared to baseline ( P < 0.05 , both group ) . The Rose-K group had statistically significantly better scores at 1 and 3 months compared with the Soper group ( P = 0.006 and P < 0.001 respectively ) . Both groups were associated with a significant ( P < 0.01 ) , but comparable improvement in glare acuity at 3 months . There was a significant improvement in contrast sensitivity at 3 months in both groups ( P < 0.01 ) ; the Rose-K group was significantly better than the Soper group at 1 and 3 months ( P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively ) . The mean number of trial lenses required for fitting Rose-K lens ( 2.00 0.59 ) was significantly lower than the Soper lens ( 3.43 0.82 ; P < 0.001 ) . Both the contact lens designs provide an equal improvement in visual acuity in patients with Keratoconus . However , Rose-K contact lens provides greater comfort , better quality of vision and requires less chair time compared with the Soper lens and hence may possibly have a greater acceptability .',\n",

       " ' To determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) - directed therapy for infants and young children with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , rather than standard therapy , was justified on the grounds of a decrease in average costs and whether the use of BAL reduced treatment costs associated with hospital admissions . Costs were assessed in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia and New Zealand on infants diagnosed with CF after newborn screening and assigned to receive either BAL-directed or standard therapy until they reached 5 years of age . A health care funder perspective was adopted . Resource use measurement was based on standardized data collection forms administered for patients across all sites . Unit costs were obtained primarily from government schedules . Mean costs per child during the study period were Australian dollars ( AUD ) 92860 in BAL-directed therapy group and AUD90958 in standard therapy group ( mean difference AUD1902 , 95 % CI AUD-27782 to 31586 , P = .90 ) . Mean hospital costs per child during the study period were AUD57302 in the BAL-directed therapy group and AUD66590 in the standard therapy group ( mean difference AUD-9288 ; 95 % CI AUD-35252 to 16676 , P = .48 ) . BAL-directed therapy did not result in either lower mean hospital admission costs or mean costs overall compared with managing patients with CF by a standard protocol based upon clinical features and oropharyngeal culture results alone . Following on our previous findings that BAL-directed treatment offers no clinical advantage over standard therapy at age 5 years , flexible bronchoscopy with BAL can not be recommended for the routine management of preschool children with CF on the basis of overall cost savings .',\n",
       " ' Recent research has investigated the use of ultrasound ( US ) for confirming endotracheal tube ( ETT ) placement with varying techniques , accuracies , and challenges . Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of a novel , simplified , four-step ( 4S ) technique . We conducted a blinded , randomized trial of the 4S technique utilizing an adult human cadaver model . ETT placement was randomized to tracheal or esophageal location . Three US experts and 45 emergency medicine residents ( EMR ) performed a total of 150 scans . The primary outcome was the overall sensitivity and specificity of both experts and EMRs to detect location of ETT placement . Secondary outcomes included a priori subgroup comparison of experts and EMRs for thin and obese cadavers , time to detection , and level of operator confidence . Experts had a sensitivity of 100 % ( 95 % CI = 72 % to 100 % ) and specificity of 100 % ( 95 % CI = 77 % to 100 % ) on thin , and a sensitivity of 93 % ( 95 % CI = 66 % to 100 % ) and specificity of 100 % ( 95 % CI = 75 % to 100 % ) on obese cadavers . EMRs had a sensitivity of 91 % ( 95 % CI = 69 % to 98 % ) and of specificity 96 % ( 95 % CI = 76 % to 100 % ) on thin , and a sensitivity of 100 % ( 95 % CI = 82 % to 100 % ) specificity of 48 % ( 95 % CI = 27 % to 69 % ) on obese cadavers . The overall mean time to detection was 17 seconds ( 95 % CI = 13 seconds to 20 seconds , range : 2 to 63 seconds ) for US experts and 29 seconds ( 95 % CI = 25 seconds to 33 seconds ; range : 6 to 120 seconds ) for EMRs . There was a statistically significant decrease in the specificity of this technique on obese cadavers when comparing the EMRs and experts , as well as an increased overall time to detection among the EMRs . The simplified 4S technique was accurate and rapid for US experts . Among novices , the 4S technique was accurate in thin , but appears less accurate in obese cadavers . Further studies will determine optimal teaching time and accuracy in emergency department patients .',\n",

The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial , a randomized , double-blind clinical trial conducted from May 19 , 2008 , to August 24 , 2013 , in 32 communities in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces in China . A total of 20,702 adults with hypertension without history of stroke or myocardial infarction ( MI ) participated in the study . Eligible participants , stratified by MTHFR C677T genotypes ( CC , CT , and TT ) , were randomly assigned to receive double-blind daily treatment with a single-pill combination containing enalapril , 10 mg , and folic acid , 0.8 mg ( n = 10,348 ) or a tablet containing enalapril , 10 mg , alone ( n = 10,354 ) . The primary outcome was first stroke . Secondary outcomes included first ischemic stroke ; first hemorrhagic stroke ; MI ; a composite of cardiovascular events consisting of cardiovascular death , MI , and stroke ; and all-cause death . During a median treatment duration of 4.5 years , compared with the enalapril alone group , the enalapril-folic acid group had a significant risk reduction in first stroke ( 2.7 % of participants in the enalapril-folic acid group vs 3.4 % in the enalapril alone group ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.79 ; 95 % CI , 0.68-0 .93 ) , first ischemic stroke ( 2.2 % with enalapril-folic acid vs 2.8 % with enalapril alone ; HR , 0.76 ; 95 % CI , 0.64-0 .91 ) , and composite cardiovascular events consisting of cardiovascular death , MI , and stroke ( 3.1 % with enalapril-folic acid vs 3.9 % with enalapril alone ; HR , 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.69-0 .92 ) . The risks of hemorrhagic stroke ( HR , 0.93 ; 95 % CI , 0.65-1 .34 ) , MI ( HR , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.60-1 .82 ) , and all-cause deaths ( HR , 0.94 ; 95 % CI , 0.81-1 .10 ) did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups . There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in the frequencies of adverse events . Among adults with hypertension in China without a history of stroke or MI , the combined use of enalapril and folic acid , compared with enalapril alone , significantly reduced the risk of first stroke . These findings are consistent with benefits from folate use among adults with hypertension and low baseline folate levels . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00794885 .',\n",
       " \" To establish whether there was a difference in health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) in people with chronic musculoskeletal disorders ( PwCMSKD ) after participating in a multimodal physiotherapy program ( MPP ) either two or three sessions a week . Total of 114 PwCMSKD participated in this prospective randomised controlled trial . An individualised MPP , consisting of exercises for mobility , motor-control , muscle strengthening , cardiovascular training , and health education , was implemented either twice a week ( G2 : n = 58 ) or three times a week ) ( G3 : n = 56 ) for 1 year . HRQoL physical and mental health state ( PHS/MHS ) , Roland Morris disability Questionnaire ( RMQ ) , Neck-Disability-Index ( NDI ) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities ' Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) were used to measure outcomes of MPP for people with chronic low back pain , chronic neck pain and osteoarthritis , respectively . Measures were taken at baseline , 8 weeks ( 8 w ) , 6 months ( 6m ) , and 1 year ( 1y ) after starting the programme . No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups ( G2 and G3 ) , except in NDI at 8 w ( -3.34 , ( CI 95 % : -6.94 / 0.84 , p = 0.025 ( scale 0-50 ) ) . All variables showed improvement reaching the following values ( from baseline to 1y ) G2 : PHS : 57.72 ( baseline : 41.17 ; ( improvement : 16.55 % ) , MHS : 74.51 ( baseline : 47.46 , 27.05 % ) , HRQoL 0.90 ( baseline : 0.72 , 18 % ) ) , HRQoL-VAS 84.29 ( baseline : 58.04 , 26.25 % ) , RMQ 4.15 ( baseline : 7.85 , 15.42 % ) , NDI 3.96 ( baseline : 21.87 , 35.82 % ) , WOMAC 7.17 ( baseline : 25.51 , 19.10 % ) . G3 : PHS : 58.64 ( baseline : 39.75 , 18.89 % ) , MHS : 75.50 ( baseline : 45.45 , ( 30.05 % ) , HRQoL 0.67 ( baseline : 0.88 , 21 % ) , HRQoL-VAS 86.91 ( baseline : 52.64 , 34.27 % ) , RMQ 4.83 ( baseline : 8.93 , 17.08 % ) , NDI 4.91 ( baseline : 23.82 , 37.82 % ) , WOMAC 6.35 ( baseline : 15.30 , 9.32 % ) . No significant differences between the two groups were found in the outcomes of a MPP except in the NDI at 8 weeks , but both groups improved in all variables during the course of 1 year under study . Implications for Rehabilitation A multimodal physiotherapy program ( MPP ) improves quality of life , overall health , and function in people with chronic musculoskeletal disease after an intervention of short , medium and long term . This implies that twice a week MPP for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain has comparable results to three times a week provision and therefore may have implications in saving resources and cost for patients and service providers without compromising the outcomes of treatment . These results can be considered not only for therapists , but also for managers who offer the services to optimise the balance cost-effectiveness of the proposed interventions .\",\n",
       " \" The beneficial role of exercise as a treatment approach in Huntington 's disease ( HD ) has support from both preclinical work and small-scale studies ; however , there have been no controlled studies of gym-based exercise in people with HD . This phase 2 randomized trial ( ISRCTN 59910670 ) assessed feasibility , safety , acceptability , and benefit of a structured exercise program . Thirty-one participants ( 16 men ; mean [ SD ] age = 50.4 [ 11.4 ] years ) were randomly allocated to intervention ( n = 16 ) or control group ( usual care ; n = 15 ) . The intervention entailed a weekly supervised gym session of stationary cycling and resistance exercises , and a twice weekly independent home-based walking program . Retention and adherence rates and adverse events were recorded . Acceptability was determined from subjective reports of tolerability and physiological measures recorded during the gym sessions . Assessment of benefit included measures of physical abilities , disease severity , and quality of life ( 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ) . Analysis of covariance was used to test outcomes of interest . The retention rate was 81 % ( 9 of the 11 individuals who started the intervention completed it ) and of the 9 who completed the program , 7 attended more than 75 % ( 9/12 ) of the gym sessions . There were no related adverse events and the intervention was well tolerated by most participants . The between-group effect estimate for the Mental Component Summary score of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( n = 9 ; intervention , n = 13 ; control ) was 7 ( 95 % CI : 0.4-13 .7 ) Moderate effect sizes for cognitive outcomes and measures of walking were also observed . Observed effect sizes for clinical outcomes suggest the structured exercise program has benefit for persons with HD ; larger scale trials are warranted.Video Abstract available ( see Video , Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A60 ) for more insights from the authors .\",\n",
       " \" To optimize positive outcomes , the design of new pharmacy services should consider the preferences of consumers with chronic condition ( s ) and their carers . ( i ) To evaluate the relative importance of community pharmacy service characteristics , from the perspective of consumers with chronic condition ( s ) and carers ; ( ii ) To compare consumer and carer preferences to health professional beliefs about ideal service characteristics for consumers . A discrete choice experiment was completed by consumers with chronic condition ( s ) and/or carers ( n = 602 ) and health professionals ( n = 297 ) , recruited from four regions in Australia . Participants were each randomized to one survey version containing four ( from a total 72 ) different choices between two new pharmacy services . Consumer and carer participants were also given an ` opt out ' alternative of current service . Each service was described using six attributes related to pharmacy service characteristics : continued medicines supply , continuity and coordinated care , location , medication management , education and information , and cost . Consumers and carers placed highest priority on continued medicines supply by a pharmacist for regular and symptom flare up medicines ( 100 priority points ) , a pharmacy located within a ` one-stop ' health center ( 61 points ) and home delivery of medicines ( 52 points ) . Although continuedmedicines supply was most important for consumers and carers , pharmacy location was perceivedby health professionals to be the most important characteristic for consumers . Participants were less inclined to choose new services if their current pharmacy offered high quality services thatwere person-centered , easy to access and responsive to their needs . Younger , more highly educated and employed participants , and those with established condition ( s ) were more likely to choose new services . Person-centered care is a fundamental tenet for pharmacy services . The provision of continued medicines supply ( e.g. through pharmacist prescribing ) , convenient and coordinated care delivered through a one stop health centre , and home delivery of medicines , should be prioritized when planning pharmacy services to best assist consumers to manage chronic conditions .\",\n",
       " \" Farm youth continue to experience high rates of injury and deaths as a result of agricultural activities . Farm machinery , especially tractors , is the most common cause of casualties to youth . A Roll-Over Protection Structure ( ROPS ) along with a fastened seatbelt can prevent almost all injuries and fatalities from tractor overturns . Despite this knowledge , the use of seatbelts by farmers on ROPS tractors remains low . This study treats farm safety as a family issue and builds on the central role of parents as teachers and role models of farm safety for youth . This research study used a longitudinal , repeated-measures , randomized-control design in which youth 10-19years of age were randomly assigned to either of two intervention groups ( parent-led group and staff-led group ) or the control group . Fathers in the parent-led group were less likely to operate ROPS tractors without a seatbelt compared with other groups . They were more likely to have communicated with youth about the importance of wearing seatbelts on ROPS tractors . Consequently , youth in the parent-led group were less likely to operate a ROPS tractor without a seatbelt than the control group at post-test . This randomized control trial supports the effectiveness of a home-based , father-led farm safety intervention as a promising strategy for reducing youth as well as father-unsafe behaviors ( related to tractor seatbelts ) on the farm . This intervention appealed to fathers ' strong motivation to practice tractor safety for the sake of their youth . Involving fathers helped change both father as well as youth unsafe tractor-seatbelt behaviors .\",\n",
       " ' Several studies have confirmed dramatic changes in skin surface parameters during the winter months . Although there are many studies supporting the positive effects of topical treatment , there are no published studies demonstrating the effects of oral supplementation in the prevention of negative skin changes during winter . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an oral micronutrient supplement in preventing the negative effects of winter weather on skin quality using noninvasive biometrologic instruments . This study included 80 healthy female volunteers aged 35-55 years with phototype II-IV skin . Randomization was balanced . Two tablets of a micronutrient supplement ( Perfectil Platinum ) or placebo were administered once daily for 4 months . The volunteers were examined at baseline , after 4 months , and 6 weeks after termination of treatment ( month 5.5 ) . The evaluation included skin microrelief by Visioscan as the main outcome , and the secondary outcomes were results on standard macrophotography , skin tension by Reviscometer , skin high-frequency ultrasound , and self-assessment . For all pseudoroughness and microrelief indicators , there was a significant increase from baseline to month 4 in the placebo group ( P < 0.05 ) but no change in the active group . Descriptive statistics for the mean minimum , mean maximum , and minimum to maximum ratio on the nonexposed study zone showed a significant and dramatic difference between baseline and month 4 and between baseline and month 5.5 ( P < 0.05 ) in the active group , indicating decreasing anisotropy of the skin . High-frequency ultrasound on the exposed study zone revealed that skin thickness was significantly decreased in the placebo group during winter but was stable in the treated group ( P < 0.01 ) . The photography scaling and self-assessment questionnaire revealed no significant changes in either group . These results indicate that the skin is prone to seasonal changes during winter , particularly in exposed areas . The data also indicate that oral supplementation can be a safe treatment , with no serious side effects , and may prevent or even eliminate the negative effects of winter on the skin .',\n",

Couples seeking fertility treatment after at least 12 months of unprotected intercourse , with the female partner aged between 18 and 38 years , an unfavourable prognosis for natural conception , and a diagnosis of unexplained or mild male subfertility . Three cycles of in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer ( plus subsequent cryocycles ) , six cycles of in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle , or six cycles of intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation within 12 months after randomisation . The primary outcome was birth of a healthy child resulting from a singleton pregnancy conceived within 12 months after randomisation . Secondary outcomes were live birth , clinical pregnancy , ongoing pregnancy , multiple pregnancy , time to pregnancy , complications of pregnancy , and neonatal morbidity and mortality 602 couples were randomly assigned between January 2009 and February 2012 ; 201 were allocated to in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer , 194 to in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle , and 207 to intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation . Birth of a healthy child occurred in 104 ( 52 % ) couples in the in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer group , 83 ( 43 % ) in the in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle group , and 97 ( 47 % ) in the intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation group . This corresponds to a risk , relative to intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation , of 1.10 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.91 to 1.34 ) for in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer and 0.91 ( 0.73 to 1.14 ) for in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle . These 95 % confidence intervals do not extend below the predefined threshold of 0.69 for inferiority . Multiple pregnancy rates per ongoing pregnancy were 6 % ( 7/121 ) after in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer , 5 % ( 5/102 ) after in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle , and 7 % ( 8/119 ) after intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation ( one sided P = 0.52 for in vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer compared with intrauterine insemination with ovarian hyperstimulation ; one sided P = 0.33 for in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle compared with intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ) . In vitro fertilisation with single embryo transfer and in vitro fertilisation in a modified natural cycle were non-inferior to intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in terms of the birth of a healthy child and showed comparable , low multiple pregnancy rates.Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN52843371 ; Nederlands Trial Register NTR939 .',\n",
       " ' The comparative risks and benefits of early compared with delayed cord clamping in the preterm neonate remain unclear . Our objective was to evaluate the short-term effects of delayed clamping of the umbilical cord in preterm neonates . We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing immediate with delayed cord clamping among preterm neonates born between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation . The primary study outcome was the need for blood transfusion . To detect a 33 % reduction in this outcome ( from 65 to 43.5 % ) with a two-tailed of 0.5 and of 0.8 required 178 patients equally divided into two groups . A total of 200 women were randomized , 99 to the delayed and 101 to the immediate clamp group . The groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics . The mean gestational age at delivery was 30.83.1 weeks in the delayed compared with 30.72.8 weeks in the immediate clamp group ( P = .64 ) . There was no statistically significant difference between groups with regard to the need for blood transfusion : 25 of 99 ( 25.3 % ) in the delayed cord clamp group received one or more blood transfusion compared with 24 of 101 ( 23.7 % ) in the immediate clamp group ( P = .8 ) . The rates of various neonatal outcomes including respiratory distress syndrome , periventricular leukomalacia , necrotizing enterocolitis , anemia of prematurity , and neonatal morality did not differ significantly between the groups .

       " ' Acute hamstring re-injuries are common and hard to predict . The aim of this study was to investigate the association between clinical and imaging findings and the occurrence of hamstring re-injuries . We obtained baseline data ( clinical and MRI findings ) of athletes who sustained an acute hamstring injury within 5days of initial injury . We also collected data of standardised clinical tests within 7days after return to play ( RTP ) . The number of re-injuries was recorded within 12months . We analysed the association between the possible predictive variables and re-injuries with a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model . Eighty patients were included at baseline and 64 patients could be included in the final analysis because data after RTP were not available in 16 cases . There were 17 re-injuries ( 27 % ) . None of the baseline MRI findings were univariately associated with re-injury . A higher number of previous hamstring injuries ( adjusted OR ( AOR ) 1.33 ; 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.61 ) , more degrees of active knee extension deficit after RTP ( AOR 1.13 ; 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.25 ) , isometric knee flexion force deficit at 15 after RTP ( AOR 1.04 ; 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.07 ) and presence of localised discomfort on hamstring palpation after RTP ( AOR 3.95 ; 95 % CI 1.38 to 11.37 ) were significant independent predictors of re-injury . Athletes with localised discomfort on hamstring palpation just after RTP were consequently almost four times more likely to sustain a re-injury . The number of previous hamstring injuries , active knee extension deficit , isometric knee flexion force deficit at 15 and presence of localised discomfort on palpation just after RTP are associated with a higher hamstring re-injury rate . None of the baseline MRI parameters was a predictor of hamstring re-injury . ClinicalTrial.gov number NCT01812564 .',\n",
       " ' Intra-arterial treatment ( IAT ) in patients with acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) can be performed with or without general anesthesia ( GA ) . Previous studies suggested that IAT without the use of GA ( non-GA ) is associated with better clinical outcome . Nevertheless , no consensus exists about the anesthetic management during IAT of AIS patients . This study investigates the association between type of anesthesia and clinical outcome in a large cohort of patients with AIS treated with IAT . All consecutive patients with AIS of the anterior circulation who received IAT between 2002 and 2013 in 16 Dutch hospitals were included in the study . Primary outcome was functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale at discharge . Difference in primary outcome between GA and non-GA was estimated using multiple ordinal regression analysis , adjusting for age , stroke severity , occlusion of the internal carotid artery terminus , previous stroke , atrial fibrillation , and diabetes mellitus . Three hundred forty-eight patients were included in the analysis ; 70 patients received GA and 278 patients did not receive GA. . Non-GA was significantly associated with good clinical outcome ( odds ratio 2.1 , 95 % confidence interval 1.02-4 .31 ) . After adjusting for prespecified prognostic factors , the point estimate remained similar ; statistical significance , however , was lost ( odds ratio 1.9 , 95 % confidence interval 0.89-4 .24 ) . Our study suggests that patients with AIS of the anterior circulation undergoing IAT without GA have a higher probability of good clinical outcome compared with patients treated with general anesthesia .',\n",

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the perivascular delivery of tissue-engineered allogeneic aortic endothelial cells ( PVS-10200 ) reduced stenosis in porcine models of SFA revascularization . The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous PVS-10200 delivery after angioplasty and stenting in the SFA of patients with peripheral artery disease . In this phase I open-label trial , 21 patients ( average lesion length of 10.10 2.36 cm and 70 % stenosis ) were treated with PVS-10200 : 11 in a low-dose cohort ( cohort A ) and 10 in a high-dose cohort ( cohort B ) . The primary objective was to demonstrate the safety ( incidence of major adverse events ) of PVS-10200 within 4 weeks after surgery . Secondary end points included assessments of resting ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) in the treated leg , Fontaine class , and time to target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) . No patient had a major adverse event within 4 weeks . One patient required a limb amputation at 30 weeks . At 48 weeks , cohort A and cohort B patients maintained a 37 % and 62 % increase in ABI compared with baseline , respectively ; 70 % of cohort A and 78 % of cohort B improved by 1 Fontaine classification stage , and the TLR rate was 39 % for cohort A and 20 % for cohort B. Percutaneous local delivery of PVS-10200 is a well-tolerated and novel therapeutic approach that may be a suitable treatment for patients after endovascular intervention of the SFA . Larger randomized trials are needed to determine if PVS-10200 can improve ABI and reduce TLR rates .',\n",

Hospitals are randomized to receive a targeted multifaceted quality improvement intervention ( experimental group ) or routine standard of care ( control group ) . The multifaceted intervention includes an evidence-based clinical pathway , written care protocols , a quality coordinator , and a monitoring and feedback system of performance measures . The number of enrolled patients in the trial will be 4,800 . Primary outcome is the measure of the adherence to AIS evidence-based performance measures including the composite measure ( defined as the total number of interventions performed among eligible patients divided by the total number of possible interventions among eligible patients ) and the all-or-none measure ( defined as the proportion of eligible patients who receive all of the performance measure interventions for which they are eligible ) . Secondary patient outcomes include inhospital death ; a new vascular event ; disability ; and all-cause death at 3 , 6 , and 12 months after initial symptom onset . All analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treatment principle and accounted for clustering using generalized estimating equations .

       " ' Administration of secretin improves noninvasive imaging of the pancreatic duct with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) . We performed a large prospective study to investigate whether synthetic human secretin ( RG1068 ) - stimulated MRCP detects pancreatic duct abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity than MRCP . We performed a phase 3 , multicenter , baseline-controlled study of patients with acute or acute recurrent pancreatitis who were scheduled to undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) between March 26 , 2008 , and October 28 , 2009 . Patients underwent a baseline MRCP that was immediately followed by administration of RG1068 and repeat MRCP and then underwent ERCP within 30 days ; they were followed up for 30 days . MRCP and ERCP images were read centrally by 3 radiologists and 2 endoscopists , respectively , who were all independent and blinded ; pancreatic duct abnormalities were evaluated . The accuracy of MRCP was evaluated using ERCP as the standard . In total , 258 patients were enrolled in the study ; 251 MRCP image sets were assessed , and 236 patients had evaluable ERCPs . Pancreatic duct abnormalities were observed in 60.2 % of ERCP images . All radiologists identified duct abnormalities in RG1068-cin MRCP image sets with significantly higher levels of sensitivity ( P < .0001 ) than in images from MRCP , with minimal loss of specificity . Adverse events were reported in 38.0 % of patients after MRCP and 68.1 % after ERCP . Of the 55 patients who experienced a serious adverse event , 3 ( 1.2 % ) and 52 ( 20.5 % ) of the events were reported to be temporally associated with MRCP and ERCP , respectively . The adverse events most frequently considered related to RG1068 were nausea , abdominal pain , and flushing ; most were mild . Compared with images from MRCP , those from RG1068-stimulated MRCP are improved in many aspects and could aid in diagnosis and clinical decision making for patients with acute , acute recurrent , or chronic pancreatitis . RG1068-enhanced MRCP might also better identify patients in need of therapeutic ERCP ( ClinicalTrials.gov , Number : NCT00660335 ) .',\n",

However , substantial barriers to psychosocial assessment exist , resulting in less than 20 % of prenatal care providers assessing and treating mental health problems . Moreover , pregnant women are often reluctant to disclose their mental health concerns to a healthcare provider . Identifying screening and assessment tools and procedures that are acceptable to both women and service providers , cost-effective , and clinically useful is needed . The primary objective of this randomized , parallel-group , superiority trial is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a computer tablet-based prenatal psychosocial assessment ( e-screening ) compared to paper-based screening . Secondary objectives are to compare the two modes of screening on : ( 1 ) the level of detection of prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms and psychosocial risk ; ( 2 ) the level of disclosure of symptoms ; ( 3 ) the factors associated with feasibility , acceptability , and disclosure ; ( 4 ) the psychometric properties of the e-version of the assessment tools ; and ( 5 ) cost-effectiveness . A sample of 542 women will be recruited from large , primary care maternity clinics and a high-risk antenatal unit in an urban Canadian city . Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they : ( 1 ) receive care at one of the recruitment sites ; ( 2 ) are able to speak/read English ; ( 3 ) are willing to be randomized to e-screening ; and ( 4 ) are willing to participate in a follow-up diagnostic interview within 1 week of recruitment . Allocation is by computer-generated randomization . Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment on a computer tablet , while those in the control group will complete the same assessment in paper-based form . All women will complete baseline questionnaires at the time of recruitment and will participate in a diagnostic interview within 1 week of recruitment . Research assistants conducting diagnostic interviews and physicians will be blinded . A qualitative descriptive study involving healthcare providers from the recruitment sites and women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention . We hypothesize that mental health e-screening in primary care maternity settings and high-risk antenatal units will be as or more feasible , acceptable , and capable of detecting depression , anxiety , and psychosocial risk compared to paper-based screening .

Patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone ( CT ) or with bevacizumab ( BEV-CT ) . PROs were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Ovarian Cancer Module 28 ( EORTC QLQ-OV28 ) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer symptom index ( FOSI ) at baseline and every two or three cycles ( 8/9 weeks ) until disease progression . The primary PRO hypothesis was that more patients receiving BEV-CT than CT would achieve at least a 15 % ( 15-point ) absolute improvement on the QLQ-OV28 abdominal/GI symptom subscale ( items 31-36 ) at week 8/9 . Patients with missing week 8/9 questionnaires were included as unimproved . Questionnaires from all assessments until disease progression were analyzed using mixed-model repeated-measures ( MMRM ) analysis . Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effects of differing assumptions and methods for missing data . Baseline questionnaires were available from 89 % of 361 randomly assigned patients . More BEV-CT than CT patients achieved a 15 % improvement in abdominal/GI symptoms at week 8/9 ( primary PRO end point , 21.9 % v 9.3 % ; difference , 12.7 % ; 95 % CI , 4.4 to 20.9 ; P = .002 ) . MMRM analysis covering all time points also favored BEV-CT ( difference , 6.4 points ; 95 % CI , 1.3 to 11.6 ; P = .015 ) . More BEV-CT than CT patients achieved 15 % improvement in FOSI at week 8/9 ( 12.2 % v 3.1 % ; difference , 9.0 % ; 95 % CI , 2.9 % to 15.2 % ; P = .003 ) . Sensitivity analyses gave similar results and conclusions . Bevacizumab increased the proportion of patients achieving a 15 % improvement in patient-reported abdominal/GI symptoms during chemotherapy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer .',\n",

However , despite recommendations from the World Health Organization , exclusive breastfeeding for six months is uncommon . Increased breastfeeding support early in the postpartum period may be effective in improving breastfeeding maintenance . This trial will evaluate two community-based interventions to increase breastfeeding duration in Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) in Victoria , Australia . A three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used . Victorian LGAs with a lower than average rate of any breastfeeding at discharge from hospital and more than 450 births per year that agree to participate will be randomly allocated to one of three trial arms : 1 ) standard care ; 2 ) home-based breastfeeding support ; or 3 ) home-based breastfeeding support plus access to a community-based breastfeeding drop-in centre . The services provided in LGAs allocated to ` standard care ' are those routinely available to postpartum women . LGAs allocated to the home-based visiting intervention will provide home-visits to women who are identified as at risk of breastfeeding cessation in the early postnatal period . These visits will be provided by Maternal and Child Health Nurses who have received training to provide the intervention ( SILC-MCHNs ) . In areas allocated to receive the second intervention , in addition to home-based breastfeeding support , community breastfeeding drop-in centres will be made available , staffed by a SILC-MCHN . The interventions will run in LGAs for a nine to twelve month period depending on birth numbers . The primary outcome is the proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at four months of age . Breastfeeding outcomes will be obtained from routinely collected Maternal and Child Health centre data and from a new data item collecting infant feeding ` in the last 24 hours ' . Information will also be obtained directly from women via a postal survey . A comprehensive process evaluation will be conducted . This study will determine if early home-based breastfeeding support by a health professional for women at risk of stopping breastfeeding , with or without access to a community-based breastfeeding drop-in centre , increases breastfeeding duration in Victorian LGAs with low breastfeeding rates .

       " ' Insulin-resistant states , including type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and prediabetes , are associated with elevated cardiovascular ( CV ) risk . Aleglitazar is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor / agonist with favorable insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering actions , favorable effects on blood lipids , and an acceptable safety profile in short-time studies . Therefore , it was hypothesized that aleglitazar would reduce CV morbidity and mortality in patients with T2D mellitus and prediabetes ( defined as glycosylated hemoglobin 5.7 % to < 6.5 % ) with previous CV complications . ALEPREVENT was a phase III , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , trial comparing aleglitazar 150 g or placebo daily in patients with T2D or prediabetes with established , stable CV disease . The intended sample size was 19,000 with a primary efficacy measure of major adverse CV events . However , the trial was halted prematurely after 1,999 patients had been randomized because of futility and an unfavorable benefit risk ratio in another CV outcomes trial evaluating aleglitazar . At study termination after 58 38 days of treatment , data had been collected from 1,996 patients ( 1,581 with T2D and 415 with pre-T2D ) . Despite the brief duration of treatment , aleglitazar induced favorable changes in glycosylated hemoglobin and blood lipids , similar for participants with T2D or prediabetes . However , compared with placebo , aleglitazar increased the incidence of hypoglycemia ( 86 vs 166 ; P < .0001 ) , and muscular events ( 3 vs12 ; P = .012 ) . Even within a short duration of exposure , aleglitazar was associated with excess adverse events , corroborating the findings of a larger and longer trial in T2D . Coupled with the previous failure of several other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor / activators , this class now holds little promise for CV therapeutics .',\n",
       " ' Monopolar electrosurgery is the gold standard for surgical preparation in thoracoscopic spine procedures . However , use of ultrasound scissors could decrease blood loss , accelerate the preparation time and improve patient safety , while minimizing operative costs . This trial compares both preparation techniques for ventral thoracoscopic spondylodesis . The study design is an open , prospective , randomized , and double-blinded two-armed clinical trial performed in two centres . Forty-one patients with vertebral body fractures from T10 to L2 were included . Primary endpoint : preparation time . Secondary endpoints : blood loss , organ injuries , duration of hospitalization . Primary and secondary endpoints did not differ significantly between groups ( p level 0.05 ) . Increased blood loss ( 150 ml or more ) was eliminated with ultrasound scissors ( p = 0.0014 ) . Primary and secondary endpoints did not differ significantly between the two preparation techniques . The use of either ultrasound scissors or electric scalpel offers safe and effective preparation for thoracoscopic spine surgery .',\n",
       " ' Delirium is frequently diagnosed in critically ill patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes . Haloperidol is the most commonly used drug for delirium despite little evidence of its effectiveness . The aim of this study was to establish whether early treatment with haloperidol would decrease the time that survivors of critical illness spent in delirium or coma . We did this double-blind , placebo-controlled randomised trial in a general adult intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Critically ill patients ( 18 years ) needing mechanical ventilation within 72 h of admission were enrolled . Patients were randomised ( by an independent nurse , in 1:1 ratio , with permuted block size of four and six , using a centralised , secure web-based randomisation service ) to receive haloperidol 2.5 mg or 0.9 % saline placebo intravenously every 8 h , irrespective of coma or delirium status . Study drug was discontinued on ICU discharge , once delirium-free and coma-free for 2 consecutive days , or after a maximum of 14 days of treatment , whichever came first . Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the ICU ( CAM-ICU ) . The primary outcome was delirium-free and coma-free days , defined as the number of days in the first 14 days after randomisation during which the patient was alive without delirium and not in coma from any cause . Patients who died within the 14 day study period were recorded as having 0 days free of delirium and coma . ICU clinical and research staff and patients were masked to treatment throughout the study . Analyses were by intention to treat . This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry , number ISRCTN83567338 . 142 patients were randomised , 141 were included in the final analysis ( 71 haloperidol , 70 placebo ) . Patients in the haloperidol group spent about the same number of days alive , without delirium , and without coma as did patients in the placebo group ( median 5 days [ IQR 0-10 ] vs 6 days [ 0-11 ] days ; p = 0.53 ) . The most common adverse events were oversedation ( 11 patients in the haloperidol group vs six in the placebo group ) and QTc prolongation ( seven patients in the haloperidol group vs six in the placebo group ) . No patient had a serious adverse event related to the study drug . These results do not support the hypothesis that haloperidol modifies duration of delirium in critically ill patients . Although haloperidol can be used safely in this population of patients , pending the results of trials in progress , the use of intravenous haloperidol should be reserved for short-term management of acute agitation .

       " \" A recently published study showed the safety and efficacy of LSD-assisted psychotherapy in patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases . Participants of this study were included in a prospective follow-up . 12 months after finishing LSD psychotherapy , 10 participants were tested for anxiety ( STAI ) and participated in a semi-structured interview . A Qualitative Content Analysis ( QCA ) was carried out on the interviews to elaborate about LSD effects and lasting psychological changes . None of the participants reported lasting adverse reactions . The significant benefits as measured with the STAI were sustained over a 12-month period . In the QCA participants consistently reported insightful , cathartic and interpersonal experiences , accompanied by a reduction in anxiety ( 77.8 % ) and a rise in quality of life ( 66.7 % ) . Evaluations of subjective experiences suggest facilitated access to emotions , confrontation of previously unknown anxieties , worries , resources and intense emotional peak experiences la Maslow as major psychological working mechanisms . The experiences created led to a restructuring of the person 's emotional trust , situational understanding , habits and world view . LSD administered in a medically supervised psychotherapeutic setting can be safe and generate lasting benefits in patients with a life-threatening disease . Explanatory models for the therapeutic effects of LSD warrant further study .\",\n",
       " ' This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a static ground reaction ankle foot orthosis and strapping system on improving gait parameters in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy . The current study was conducted at the physical therapy faculty of Cairo University , Egypt . This study included 57 children of both sexes , aged 6 to 8 years . Three-armed randomized control trial . Participants in all groups received a traditional neuro-developmental physical therapy program that included standing and gait training exercises . Children in group A performed the training program without any orthotic management , in group B with the TheraTogs strapping system , and in group C with the TheraTogs strapping system and static ground reaction ankle foot orthoses . Children underwent treatment for two hours daily , except on weekends , for twelve successive weeks . Gait speed , cadence , stride length , and hip and knee flexion angles in the mid-stance phase were evaluated pre-and post-treatment using a three-dimensional motion analysis system ( pre-reflex system ) . Statistically significant differences were recorded among the three groups post-treatment in gait speed , cadences , and stride length . The P-values for these variable differences were 0.03 , 0.011 , and 0.001 respectively . Significant post-treatment differences were also recorded for bilateral hip-and knee-flexion angles . For all measured parameters , better significant results were registered for group C than for the other groups . Orthotic intervention composed of a static ground reaction ankle foot orthosis combined with the TheraTogs strapping system improves gait more than conventional treatment with or without TheraTogs in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy .',\n",

A total of 15 healthy male sport students were randomly allocated to an intervention ( IG , n = 10 ) and a non-treatment control group ( CG , n = 5 ) . Calf muscles of both legs in the IG were stimulated equally twice a week over 6 weeks . The protocol was 35 s on , 10 s off , 150 s impulse width , 30 Hz above the individual CTF , and was at 85 % of the maximal tolerated stimulation energy . One leg was stimulated in a shortened position , inducing muscle cramps ( CT ) , while the opposite leg was fixated in a neutral position at the ankle , hindering muscle cramps ( nCT ) . CTF tests were performed prior to the first and 96 h after the 6 ( th ) ( 3 w ) and 12 ( th ) ( 6 w ) training session . After 3 w , the CTF had significantly ( p < 0.001 ) increased in CT calves from 23.35.7 Hz to 33.36.9 Hz , while it remained unchanged in nCT ( pre : 23.65.7 Hz , mid : 22.33.5 Hz ) and in both legs of the CG ( pre : 21.83.2 Hz , mid : 22.02.7 Hz ) . Only CT saw further insignificant increases in the CTF . The applied stimulation energy ( mA s ) positively correlated with the effect on the CTF ( r = 0.92 ; p < 0.001 ) .

       " ' To determine the effects of addition of different dosages of gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) to routine luteal phase support ( LPS ) on implantation and pregnancy rates . Three hundred infertile couples who were treated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo transfer ( ICSI-ET ) following controlled ovarian stimulation ( COS ) with long luteal GnRH agonist protocol were enrolled . All women received 600 mg/day vaginal micronized progesterone plus 4 mg 17 estradiol for LPS starting from the day of oocyte retrieval . Patients ( n = 300 ) were randomized into three treatment groups . Group A ( n = 100 ) received leuprolide acetate 1 mg s.c. injection 3 days after ET in addition to routine LPS . Group B ( n = 100 ) received two sequential doses of leuprolide acetate 1 mg s.c. injections 3 and 6 days after ET in addition to routine LPS . Control group ( n = 100 ) received only the routine LPS . A total of 279 patients completed the study . The groups were comparable in terms of baseline demographic parameters including age , duration of infertility and day 3 levels of FSH and estradiol . The cycle parameters of the groups were also comparable regarding the E2 level on day of hCG , number of retrieved oocytes , number of day 3 embryos , number of embryos transferred , and endometrial thickness on both days of OPU and ET . The implantation rates were similar in between the Groups A , B , and control group ( 20.7 % and 25.8 % vs. 13.3 % , respectively ; P = .099 ) . The clinical pregnancy rates and miscarriage rates were similar in between the groups . The ongoing pregnancy rates were 27.4 % in control group , 36 % in Group A and 42.9 % in Group B ( P = .093 ) .

       " ' Obesity-induced chronic inflammation is a key component of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance . Mounting evidence has demonstrated anti-inflammatory characteristics for vitamin D. Although analogues of vitamin D3 have extensively been used in the treatment of various chronic inflammatory diseases , to our knowledge , no such research is conducted in regards with obesity . The aim of this double blind clinical trial study is to investigate whether alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects can affect the cytokine profile and insulin resistance . Moreover , we evaluated the pathways of vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , PPAR and PGC1 gene expressions which may lead to insulin resistance following treatment with either alphacalcidol or placebo . A total of 94 obese participants ( BMI30 ) were recruited for the current double blind clinical trial study . Patients were divided into two intervention ( N. = 40 ) and control groups ( N. = 54 ) based on the stratified randomized method . One-Alpha Capsules 1 microgram : alfacalcidol ( 1 - hydroxyvitamin D3 ) and placebo were given to subjects once a day for 8 weeks . Analysis of body composition was performed with use of Body Composition Analyzer . The circulating levels of TNF - , IL-1 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-13 , IL-17 , PTH , and 25-Hydroxy Vi-tamin D were measured with the use of EIA method . The PBMCs were separated from whole blood by Ficoll-hypaque technique . Total cellular RNA was extracted and the cDNA was synthesized . The real-time PCR using specific primer pairs for VDR , PGC1 , PPAR , and - actin was performed . The FPG , fat percent and PTH levels were decreased and the levels of HDL-cholesterol and 25-hydroxy vitamin D were significantly increased after treatment with Alfacalcidol . Regarding to cytokines levels , the levels of IL6 were significantly decreased and IL10 were significantly increased in Alfacalcidol group in comparison with the control group . The relative expressions of VDR , PGC1 , and PPAR genes significantly increased in Alfacalcidol group . We found also significant positive correlation between circulating 25-OH vitamin D and relative PGC1 gene expression in participants with insulin resistance . It seems that Alfacalcidol treatment may be effective in amelioration of the inflammatory state in obesity . This supplement might also improve resistance to insulin through enhancement of relative VDR and its downstream genes expression , which are demonstrated to be involved in glucose homeostasis pathways .',\n",

       " ' High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity , which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy . The impact of protein from meats for breastfed infants during complementary feeding may be different . We examined the effect of protein from meat as complementary foods on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants . This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants ( 5-6 mo old from the Denver , CO , metro area ) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats ( Meat group ; n = 14 ) or infant cereal ( Cereal group ; n = 28 ) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo. . Anthropometric measures and diet records were collected monthly from 5 to 9 mo of age ; intakes from complementary feeding and breast milk were assessed at 9 mo of age . The Meat group had significantly higher protein intake , whereas energy , carbohydrate , and fat intakes from complementary feeding did not differ by group over time . At 9 mo of age , mean ( SEM ) intakes of total ( complementary feeding plus breast milk ) protein were 2.9 0.6 and 1.4 0.4 g kg ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) , 17 % and 9 % of daily energy intake , for Meat and Cereal groups , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) . From 5 to 9 mo of age , the weight-for-age z score ( WAZ ) and length-for-age z score ( LAZ ) increased in the Meat group ( WAZ : 0.24 0.19 ; LAZ : 0.14 0.12 ) and decreased in the Cereal group ( WAZ : -0.07 0.17 ; LAZ : -0.27 0.24 ) ( P-group by time < 0.05 ) . The change in weight-for-length z score did not differ between groups . Total protein intake at 9 mo of age and baseline WAZ were important predictors of changes in the WAZ ( R ( 2 ) = 0.23 , P = 0.01 ) . In breastfed infants , higher protein intake from meats was associated with greater linear growth and weight gain but without excessive gain in adiposity , suggesting that potential risks of high protein intake may differ between breastfed and formula-fed infants and by the source of protein .',\n",
       " \" We aimed to examine the association between total number of resected nodes and survival in patients after esophagectomy with and without nCRT . Most studies concerning the potentially positive effect of extended lymphadenectomy on survival have been performed in patients who underwent surgery alone . As nCRT is known to frequently `` sterilize '' regional nodes , it is unclear whether extended lymphadenectomy after nCRT is still useful . Patients from the randomized CROSS-trial who completed the entire protocol ( ie , surgery alone or chemoradiotherapy + surgery ) were included . With Cox regression models , we compared the impact of number of resected nodes as well as resected positive nodes on survival in both groups . One hundred sixty-one patients underwent surgery alone , and 159 patients received multimodality treatment . The median ( interquartile range ) number of resected nodes was 18 ( 12-27 ) and 14 ( 9-21 ) , with 2 ( 1-6 ) and 0 ( 0-1 ) resected positive nodes , respectively . Persistent lymph node positivity after nCRT had a greater negative prognostic impact on survival as compared with lymph node positivity after surgery alone . The total number of resected nodes was significantly associated with survival for patients in the surgery-alone arm ( hazard ratio per 10 additionally resected nodes , 0.76 ; P = 0.007 ) , but not in the multimodality arm ( hazard ratio 1.00 ; P = 0.98 ) . The number of resected nodes had a prognostic impact on survival in patients after surgery alone , but its therapeutic value is still controversial . After nCRT , the number of resected nodes was not associated with survival . These data question the indication for maximization of lymphadenectomy after nCRT .\",\n",

In this randomized controlled trial , 80 patients who met the inclusion criteria were conveniently sampled and randomly allocated to the experimental and control groups after they were matched on age and gender . On the days following surgery , the experimental group received foot reflexology massage on their left foot 20mina day for 4 days , while the control group was given a gentle foot rub with oil for one minute . Anxiety was measured using the short-form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety .

       " ' To estimate the effect of sequence on response precision and response behavior in health valuation studies . Time trade-off ( TTO ) and paired comparison responses from six health valuation studies-four US , one Spanish , and one Dutch-were examined ( 22,225 respondents ) to test whether task sequence influences response precision ( e.g. , rounding ) , response changes , and median response times . Each study used a computer-based instrument that randomized task sequence among a national sample of adults , age 18 years or older , from the general population . For both TTO and paired comparisons , median response times decreased with sequence ( i.e. , learning ) , but tended to flatten after the first three tasks . Although the paired comparison evidence demonstrated that sequence had no effect on response precision , the frequency of rounded TTO responses ( to either 1-year or 5-year units ) increased with sequence . Based on these results , randomizing or reducing the number of paired comparison tasks does not appear to influence response precision ; however , generalizability , practicality , and precautionary considerations remain . Overall , participants learned to respond efficiently within the first three tasks and did not resort to satisficing , but may have rounded their TTO responses .',\n",

They were divided in two groups : first group received chemotherapy + metformin ( 850 mg three times a day ) ; second group only received standard chemotherapy . The sample was randomized 3:1 in favor of the second group . 93 patients were included ( 73 treated with chemotherapy + metformin and 20 received standard chemotherapy ) , with 303 53 days of follow-up . Complete remission was higher in the group without metformin ( 81.3 % [ n = 61 ] versus 70 % [ n = 14 ] ) , which also presented more patients with relapse ( 47.9 % versus 25 % ) . Overall survival at one year was of 68 % and free survival disease was 64 % , without significant differences between groups . Absence of metformin was the only variable of adverse prognostic considered significant ( p = 0.55 ) . Cox regression showed that adding metfomin reduced 56 % the risk of relapse . The adding metformin to the treatment of leukemias showed that was useful in our research .

Ward-based pharmacy interventions to reduce medication-related harm have not been evaluated in surgical patients . This multicentre prospective clinical trial evaluated a protocolled , ward-based pharmacy method compared with standard pharmaceutical care in surgical patients . Allocation of study group was done by one-time randomization at ward level . Consecutive patients admitted for elective surgery with an expected hospital stay longer than 48 h were included . Pharmacy practitioners performed bedside medication reconciliation at admission and discharge , and hospital pharmacists undertook regular medication reviews in the study wards . Preventable ADEs and clinical outcomes were assessed . A total of 1094 surgical patients were studied . Some 880 specific interventions were made by the hospital pharmacist to improve pharmacotherapy in 309 of 547 patients on study wards . A further 547 patients were included on control wards .

Over a median follow-up of 23 years , 130 ocular operations were performed in 63 of 711 patients assigned to intensive therapy ( 8.9 % ) and 189 ocular operations in 98 of 730 patients assigned to conventional therapy ( 13.4 % ) ( P < 0.001 ) . After adjustment for DCCT baseline factors , intensive therapy was associated with a reduction in the risk of any diabetes-related ocular surgery by 48 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 29 to 63 ; P < 0.001 ) and a reduction in the risk of all such ocular procedures by 37 % ( 95 % CI , 12 to 55 ; P = 0.01 ) . Forty-two patients who received intensive therapy and 61 who received conventional therapy underwent cataract extraction ( adjusted risk reduction with intensive therapy , 48 % ; 95 % CI , 23 to 65 ; P = 0.002 ) ; 29 patients who received intensive therapy and 50 who received conventional therapy underwent vitrectomy , retinal-detachment surgery , or both ( adjusted risk reduction , 45 % ; 95 % CI , 12 to 66 ; P = 0.01 ) . The costs of surgery were 32 % lower in the intensive-therapy group . The beneficial effects of intensive therapy were fully attenuated after adjustment for mean glycated hemoglobin levels over the entire follow-up . Intensive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes was associated with a substantial reduction in the long-term risk of ocular surgery .

       " ' The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variance can influence the efficacy of glibenclamide in patients with type 2 diabetes . A total of 747 patients with type 2 diabetes was enrolled from the Xiaoke Pills Clinical Trial , which is a double-blind , randomised controlled trial . All the patients had been treated with glibenclamide for 48 weeks , with strict drug dose adjustment and data collection . Treatment failure was confirmed when patients reached the criteria for terminating their participation in the study ( fasting blood glucose level 7.0 mmol/l on two consecutive tests 4 weeks after reaching the pre-set maximal dose or maximal tolerated dose ) . Using this cohort , we tested 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 27 gene regions . The genes in our study were involved in the metabolism of sulfonylureas , islet beta cell function , insulin resistance and beta cell growth and differentiation . A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between genetic variants and treatment failure over a period of 48 weeks . We found that no SNP reached the significance level of p < 0.00125 if Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple testing in the logistic regression model used in this pharmacogenetic study . Participants with the minor allele C of rs10811661 in CDKN2A/CDKN2B showed a significantly greater reduction in fasting blood glucose ( TT vs TC vs CC : 9.3 % ( 0-20 .0 % ) vs 9.2 % ( 0.9-20 .5 % ) vs 12.7 % ( 5.2-24 .4 % ) , p = 0.008 ) after the initial 4 weeks of treatment independent of age , sex and BMI . There was a significant difference in beta cell function among carriers of different genotypes of rs10811661 . Our study demonstrated that the CDKN2A/CDKN2B gene may be nominally associated with the efficacy of glibenclamide , and that CDKN2A/CDKN2B is associated with beta cell function .',\n",

However , most of these were conducted among a non-Asian population at a single institution . Therefore , the aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of the Pillar implant in Asian patients with simple snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) at multiple centers . Multicenter prospective clinical trials . This study included consecutive subjects with simple snoring or mild OSA . We examined subjective symptoms ( snoring intensity , frequency , witnessed apnea , and daytime sleepiness ) and objective snoring and respiratory parameters ( snoring duration [ proportion of sleep while snoring louder than 50 dB ] , snoring loudness , apnea-hypopnea index , respiratory disturbance index , minimum arterial oxygen saturation , and oxygen desaturation index4 % ) at 3 to 6 months after surgery . Adverse events were also investigated . Twenty-nine subjects with mild SDB completed the study . Whole group analysis found significant improvements in various subjective symptoms , but not in the objective snoring and respiratory parameters . A subgroup analysis of subjects with mild OSA ( n = 11 ) found significant alleviation in various subjective symptoms , apnea-hypopnea index , respiratory disturbance index , and oxygen desaturation index4 % . No major complication related to surgery was observed , and most minor adverse effects were resolved without morbidity . In selected Korean patients , the Pillar implant significantly improved not only subjective symptoms of mild SDB but also respiratory disturbances in mild OSA . 2b .',\n",
       " ' The study objective was to determine the impact of diabetes on radial artery and saphenous vein graft occlusion and clinical outcomes more than 5 years after coronary artery bypass surgery in the multicenter Radial Artery Patency Study ( NCT00187356 ) . A total of 529 patients aged less than 80 years with triple-vessel disease undergoing coronary bypass surgery participated in this study . Angiographic follow-up occurred more than 5 years after surgery with annual clinical follow-up . The primary objective was to compare the proportion of complete graft occlusion between radial artery and saphenous vein grafts among diabetic and nondiabetic persons . Additional objectives included determining predictors of complete graft occlusion and comparison of major adverse cardiac events defined by cardiac death , late myocardial infarction , and reintervention . There were 148 of 529 patients ( 27.8 % ) with diabetes ; 269 patients ( 83/269 [ 30.9 % ] diabetic ) underwent late angiography at mean of 7.71.5 years after surgery . In diabetic patients , the proportion of complete graft occlusion was significantly lower in the radial grafts ( 4/83 [ 4.8 % ] ) than in the saphenous grafts ( 21/83 [ 25.3 % ] ) ( P = .0004 ) , and this was similar in nondiabetic patients ( P = .19 ) . Multivariate modeling showed that the use of the radial artery and high-grade target vessel stenosis were protective against late graft occlusion , whereas female gender , smoking history , and elevated creatinine were associated with an increased risk ; interaction between diabetic status and conduit type also was significant ( P = .02 ) . Major adverse cardiac events were higher in diabetic patients ( 23/148 [ 15.5 % ] vs 35/381 [ 9.2 % ] , P = .04 ) . The use of the radial artery should be strongly considered in diabetic patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery , especially with high-grade target vessel stenosis .',\n",
       " ' Andropause and aging are associated with neuroendocrine dysfunctions . Growth hormone and testosterone play a significant role in several processes affecting adaptation and thereby also everyday functioning . The aim of this research project was to evaluate the effects of recombinant human growth hormone and testosterone enanthate injections on body mass and body composition , aerobic and anaerobic fitness and lipid profile in middle-aged men . The research group was comprised of 14 men aged 45 - 60 years . Two series of laboratory analyses were performed . Independent tests were carried out at baseline and after 12 weeks of the experiment . The data were analyzed using Statistica 9.1 software . A two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of the intervention programme on fat-free mass ( ( 2 ) = 0.34 ) , total body fat ( ( 2 ) = 0.79 ) , total cholesterol ( ( 2 ) = 0.30 ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ( 2 ) = 0.31 ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ( 2 ) = 0.42 ) , triglyceride ( ( 2 ) = 0.28 ) , testosterone ( ( 2 ) = 0.52 ) , insulin-like growth factor 1 ( ( 2 ) = 0.47 ) and growth hormone ( ( 2 ) = 0.63 ) . Furthermore , ANOVA revealed a statistically significant effect of the rhGH and T treatment on maximal oxygen uptake ( ( 2 ) = 0.63 ) , anaerobic threshold ( ( 2 ) = 0.61 ) and maximal work rate ( ( 2 ) = 0.53 ) . It should be emphasized that the lipid profile was affected not only by rhGH + T replacement therapy , but also by the prescribed physical activity programme . The strength and endurance fitness programme alone did not cause significant changes in body mass and composition , nor the anaerobic and aerobic capacity . On the other hand , the rhGH = T treatment stimulated these changes significantly .',\n",

This was a prospective , randomized , controlled trial in a community population . Subjects 50 years of age who previously completed validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaires were randomized ( stratified by age , sex , and reflux symptoms ) to one of three screening techniques ( either sEGD or uTNE in a mobile research van ( muTNE ) or uTNE in a hospital outpatient endoscopy suite ( huTNE ) ) and invited to participate . Of the 459 subjects , 209 ( 46 % ) agreed to participate ( muTNE n = 76 , huTNE n = 72 , and sEGD n = 61 ) . Participation rates were numerically higher in the unsedated arms of muTNE ( 47.5 % ) and huTNE ( 45.7 % ) compared with the sEGD arm ( 40.7 % ) , but were not statistically different ( P = 0.27 ) . Complete evaluation of the esophagus was similar using muTNE ( 99 % ) , huTNE ( 96 % ) , and sEGD ( 100 % ) techniques ( P = 0.08 ) . Mean recovery times ( min ) were longer for sEGD ( 67.3 ) compared with muTNE ( 15.5 ) and huTNE ( 18.5 ) ( P < 0.001 ) . Approximately 80 % of uTNE subjects were willing to undergo the procedure again in future . Respectively , 29 % and 7.8 % of participating subjects had esophagitis and BE . Mobile van and clinic uTNE screening had comparable clinical effectiveness with similar participation rates and safety profile to sEGD . Evaluation time with uTNE was significantly shorter . Prevalence of BE and esophagitis in community subjects 50 years of age was substantial . Mobile and outpatient unsedated techniques may provide an effective alternative strategy to sEGD for esophageal assessment and BE screening .\",\n",
       " ' Although medical intervention is the first option for treatment of nasal polyps , surgery is still a therapeutic option for symptomatic cases that do not respond or partially respond to medical intervention . However , there is a need for high-level evidence for the preoperative use of steroids in nasal polyposis surgery . We aimed to assess the perioperative effect of preoperative use of oral prednisolone for advanced-stage diffuse nasal polyposis . Prospective , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study . A visual analog scale ( VAS ) was evaluated for smell , nasal discharge , nasal obstruction , facial pressure , headache , butanol smell threshold , and peak nasal inspiratory flow ( PNIF ) before and after the use of study drug . Perioperative bleeding volume , visibility of operative field , operative time , hospital stay , and complication rate were also evaluated . The improvement in the corticosteroid group ( CG ) in the VAS scores , butanol thresholds , and PNIF values showed statistically significant differences compared to the placebo group ( PG ) ( P < .05 ) . The perioperative bleeding volume , visibility score , operative time , and hospital stay for CG/PG were 141 mL/384 mL , 2.4 / 3.4 , 61 min/71 .6 min , and 1.1 day/1 .8 day , respectively ( P < .05 ) . The difference between the complication rates for the two groups did not show any statistically significant difference ( P = .214 ) . Preoperative administration of systemic corticosteroids improves the perioperative visibility by reducing blood loss and shortens the operation time . We recommend the use of preoperative corticosteroid for the safety of the patients . The optimum dose and duration have not been established and require further studies . 1b .',\n",

We examined the effect of HCQ on insulin resistance in subjects without diabetes mellitus with stable RA . Twenty-three RA subjects not currently using HCQ completed a 16-week , double-blind crossover study . Subjects were randomly allocated to receive HCQ ( 6.5 mg/kg/day ) or placebo for the first 8 weeks , followed by crossover to the other arm for the final 8 weeks . Subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance testing and fasting lipid measurements at baseline , 8 weeks , and 16 weeks . The change SD from baseline in insulin sensitivity index ( ISI ) , homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , and lipid parameters were compared between placebo and HCQ using linear regression . The mean patient age was 56 years , with 96 % women , and the median body mass index was 26.0 kg/m2 . After 8 weeks of HCQ , the mean SD ISI increase was 0.4 2.9 compared with a small increase during placebo of 0.14 3.1 ( adjusted P = 0.785 ) , and the mean SD HOMA-IR decrease was 0.3 1.5 during HCQ versus a decrease of 0.42 1.4 during placebo ( adjusted P = 0.308 ) .

Studies from Lebanon report disappointingly low breastfeeding exclusivity and continuation rates . Evidence reveals that antenatal breastfeeding education , professional lactation support , and peer lay support are individually effective at increasing breastfeeding duration and exclusivity , particularly in low-income settings . Given the complex nature of the breastfeeding ecosystem and its barriers in Lebanon , we hypothesize that a complex breastfeeding support intervention , which is centered on the three components mentioned above , would significantly increase breastfeeding rates . A multi-center randomized controlled trial . 443 healthy pregnant women in their first trimester will be randomized to control or intervention group . A `` prenatal/postnatal '' professional and peer breastfeeding support package continuing till 6 months postpartum , guided by the Social Network and Social Support Theory . Control group will receive standard prenatal and postnatal care . Mothers will be followed up from early pregnancy till five years after delivery . Total and exclusive breastfeeding rates , quality of life at 1 , 3 and 6 months postpartum , maternal breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes at 6 months postpartum , maternal exclusive breastfeeding rates of future infants up to five years from baseline , cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of the intervention . Descriptive and regression analysis will be conducted under the intention to treat basis using the most recent version of SPSS . Exclusive breastfeeding is a cost-effective public health measure that has a significant impact on infant morbidity and mortality . In a country with limited healthcare resources like Lebanon , developing an effective breastfeeding promotion and support intervention that is easily replicated across various settings becomes a priority . If positive , the results of this study would provide a generalizable model to bolster breastfeeding promotion efforts and contribute to improved child health in Lebanon and the Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) region .

       " ' Beta-blockers ( BBs ) improve outcomes in heart failure . Results from the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study in Elderly ( CIBIS-ELD ) trial previously demonstrated the feasibility of heart rate , not maximum dose , as a treatment goal . In this pre-specified analysis , we investigated the prognostic value of achieved heart rate after BB optimization on long-term mortality . Elderly heart failure patients from the CIBIS-ELD trial were invited to participate in a follow-up examination 4 years after the initial 12-week BB up-titration period . The relationship between all-cause mortality , BB dose , and heart rate after titration and potentially confounding clinical variables was analysed by multivariable Cox regression . In total , 728 patients ( 38 % women ; mean age 72.9 5.4 years ) were included . During a mean follow-up period of 45 9 months , 134 patients ( 19 % ) died , thus accumulating 2268 patient-years at risk . There was no significant difference in baseline heart rate for survivors and non-survivors ( P = 0.19 ) . In models adjusting for age , sex , BB pre-treatment , ventricular function , heart rate , and NYHA class at baseline , a heart rate increase by 10 b.p.m. following up-titration was associated with a subsequent mortality hazard ratio of 1.19 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.02-1 .38 , P = 0.023 ) . The heart rate range with the lowest mortality and the fewest treatment-related adverse events was 55-64 b.p.m. The achieved BB dose was not associated with mortality risk . The heart rate after up-titration , but not BB dose , predicted all-cause mortality risk in elderly patients with chronic heart failure . These patients should be titrated to resting heart rates between 55 and 64 b.p.m.',\n",
       " ' Regional analgesic techniques are commonly used in pediatric urology . Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block has recently gained popularity . However , there is a paucity of information supporting a benefit over regional field infiltration . We present a parallel group , randomized , controlled trial evaluating ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block superiority over surgeon delivered regional field infiltration for children undergoing open pyeloplasty at a tertiary referral center . Following ethics board approval and registration , children 0 to 6 years old were recruited and randomized to undergo perioperative transversus abdominis plane block or regional field infiltration for early post-pyeloplasty pain control . General anesthetic delivery , surgical technique and postoperative analgesics were standardized . A blinded assessor regularly captured pain scores in the recovery room using the FLACC ( Face , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ) scale . The primary outcome was the need for rescue morphine administration based on a FLACC score of 3 or higher . Two pediatric urologists performed 57 pyeloplasties during a 2.5-year period , enrolling 32 children ( 16 in each group , balanced for age and weight ) . There were statistically significant differences in the number of children requiring rescue morphine administration ( 13 of 16 receiving transversus abdominis plane block and 6 of 16 receiving regional field infiltration , p = 0.011 ) , mean SD total morphine consumption ( 0.066 0.051 vs 0.028 0.040 mg/kg , p = 0.021 ) and mean SD pain scores ( 5 5 vs 2 3 , p = 0.043 ) in the recovery room , in favor of surgeon administered regional field infiltration . No local anesthetic specific adverse events were noted . Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block is not superior to regional field infiltration with bupivacaine as a strategy to minimize early opioid requirements following open pyeloplasty in children . Instead , our data suggest that surgeon delivered regional field infiltration provides better pain control .',\n",

In this randomized , prospective , double-blind , comparative study , women ( n = 20 per group ) with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , eczema , acne , or rosacea used a test gentle foaming liquid facial cleanser containing HMPs or a commercial gentle liquid nonfoaming facial cleanser daily for 3weeks . Investigators assessed irritation and skin condition . Study subjects also assessed their skin properties and the performance of each cleanser . Clinicians as well as study subjects consistently rated the test cleanser as effective or slightly more effective at improving symptoms than the commercial cleanser , although no significant differences between groups were observed . At weeks 1 and 3 , respectively , more users of the commercial cleanser reported irritation ( 20 % and 10 % ) than users of the test cleanser ( 5 % and 5 % ) . In addition , subject self-assessments of skin condition and cleansing properties were slightly more improved with the test cleanser than with the commercial cleanser . Both the test foaming cleanser containing HMPs and the commercial nonfoaming cleanser were effective and well accepted by most women in the study . Improvements were observed by both clinicians and subjects in the group using the test cleanser containing HMPs in all evaluated skin categories .',\n",

They were equally divided into general anesthesia ( GA ) group and EA + GA group . Patients of the EA + GA group were treated with EA stimulation ( 2 Hz/100 Hz ) of the bilateral Fengchi ( GB 20 ) , Shuaigu ( GB 8 ) and acupuncture stimulation of Quanliao ( SI 18 ) , Zulinqi ( GB 41 ) and Taichong ( LR 3 ) , and not given intubation during surgery . Patients of the GA group were treated with intravenous administration of Propofol , Fentanyl , Midazolam , Isopropanol , etc. . In addition , all the patients were given with controlled hypotension by intravenous injection of Propofol and Fentanyl . Dosages of Propofol and Sulfentanyl used were recorded . Karnofsky performance status scale was used to assess the patient 's general well-being and activities of daily life . The craniocerebral tumor-removal surgery was successful in all the 20 patients . Compared with the GA group , the dosages of Sulfentanyl and Propofol of the EA + GA group were significantly lower ( P < 0.05 ) . No significant difference was found between the GA and EA + GA groups in Karnofsky performance scores ( P > 0.05 ) . Patients of the EA+GA group experienced successful tumour-removal surgery without trachea cannula , were awake and could make a good cooperation with the operator during surgery .

Our primary outcome was self-reported pain scores on a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) immediately following laminaria insertion . Secondary outcome was self-reported VAS pain score indicating the maximum level of pain experienced during the 24-48-h interval between laminaria insertion and D&E procedure . Seventy-two women were enrolled , and data for 67 women were analyzed , only two of whom were more than 21 weeks on gestation . The range of pain scores at both time points was large ( 1-90 mm at laminaria insertion ; 0-100mm in laminaria-D & E interval ) . Mean pain scores were not different between treatment groups at laminaria insertion , ( 33 vs. 32 , p = .8 ) or in the laminaria - D&E interval ( 43 vs. 44 , p = .9 ) . Intrauterine administration of 5 cc of 2 % lidocaine in addition to paracervical block did not reduce pain with laminaria insertion when compared to paracervical block with saline placebo . Intrauterine lidocaine combined with paracervical block does not improve pain control at laminaria insertion when compared with paracervical block and saline placebo . Wide variation in pain scores and persistent pain after laminaria insertion suggests patient would benefit from more effective methods of pain control at laminaria insertion and during the post-laminaria interval .',\n",

A randomized clinical trial in which medical students ( n = 55 ) were randomly assigned to an `` encouraged '' ( n = 28 ) or `` discouraged '' ( n = 27 ) group . Participants underwent personality tests to assess decision-making styles , and were then trained on basic tasks ( `` burn '' then `` cut '' ) on a laparoscopic surgery simulator . After randomization , students assisted at a simulated laparoscopic salpingectomy . The senior surgeon used either an `` encourage '' script ( eg , `` Your opinion is important . '' ) or a `` discourage '' script ( eg , `` Do what I say . Save questions for next time . '' ) Otherwise , the surgery was conducted identically . Subsequently , a surgical mistake was made by the senior surgeon when he instructed students to cut without burning . Students were considered to have spoken up if they questioned the instruction and did not cut . Potential personality bias was assessed with two validated personality tests before simulation . Data were processed with Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact tests . The students in the encouraged group were significantly more likely to speak up ( 23 of 28 [ 82 % ] vs 8 of 27 [ 30 % ] ; p < 0.001 ) . There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in personality traits , student training level ( p = 1.0 ) , or sex ( p = 0.53 ) . A discouraging environment decreases the frequency with which trainees speak up when witnessing a surgical error . The senior surgeon plays an important role in improving intraoperative communication between junior and senior clinicians and can enhance patient safety .\",\n",

Gelatin nanoparticles ( GNPs ) are biocompatible and biodegradable immunological inert drug delivery systems that protect CpG-ODN against nuclease degeneration . Preliminary studies on the inhalation of GNP-bound CpG-ODN in RAO-affected horses have shown promising results . The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of GNP-bound CpG-ODN in a double-blinded , placebo-controlled , prospective , randomized clinical trial and to verify a sustained effect post-treatment . Twenty-four RAO-affected horses received 1 inhalation every 2 days for 5 consecutive administrations . Horses were examined for clinical , endoscopic , cytological , and blood biochemical variables before the inhalation regimen ( I ) , immediately afterwards ( II ) , and 4 weeks post-treatment ( III ) . At time points I and II , administration of treatment rather than placebo corresponded to a statistically significant decrease in respiratory effort , nasal discharge , tracheal secretion , and viscosity , AaDO2 and neutrophil percentage , and an increase in arterial oxygen pressure . Administration of a GNP-bound CpG-ODN formulation caused a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory-induced clinical variables in RAO-affected horses . This treatment , therefore , provides an innovative , promising , and well-tolerated strategy beyond conventional symptomatic long-term therapy and could serve as a model for asthma treatment in humans .',\n",
       " \" Some patients with lower leg amputations may be candidates for motorized prosthetic limbs . Optimal control of such devices requires accurate classification of the patient 's ambulation mode ( eg , on level ground or ascending stairs ) and natural transitions between different ambulation modes . To determine the effect of including electromyographic ( EMG ) data and historical information from prior gait strides in a real-time control system for a powered prosthetic leg capable of level-ground walking , stair ascent and descent , ramp ascent and descent , and natural transitions between these ambulation modes . Blinded , randomized crossover clinical trial conducted between August 2012 and November 2013 in a research laboratory at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago . Participants were 7 patients with unilateral above-knee ( n = 6 ) or knee-disarticulation ( n = 1 ) amputations . All patients were capable of ambulation within their home and community using a passive prosthesis ( ie , one that does not provide external power ) . Electrodes were placed over 9 residual limb muscles and EMG signals were recorded as patients ambulated and completed 20 circuit trials involving level-ground walking , ramp ascent and descent , and stair ascent and descent . Data were acquired simultaneously from 13 mechanical sensors embedded on the prosthesis . Two real-time pattern recognition algorithms , using either ( 1 ) mechanical sensor data alone or ( 2 ) mechanical sensor data in combination with EMG data and historical information from earlier in the gait cycle , were evaluated . The order in which patients used each configuration was randomized ( 1:1 blocked randomization ) and double-blinded so patients and experimenters did not know which control configuration was being used . The main outcome of the study was classification error for each real-time control system . Classification error is defined as the percentage of steps incorrectly predicted by the control system . Including EMG signals and historical information in the real-time control system resulted in significantly lower classification error ( mean , 7.9 % [ 95 % CI , 6.1 % -9.7 % ] ) across a mean of 683 steps ( range , 640-756 steps ) compared with using mechanical sensor data only ( mean , 14.1 % [ 95 % CI , 9.3 % -18.9 % ] ) across a mean of 692 steps ( range , 631-775 steps ) , with a mean difference between groups of 6.2 % ( 95 % CI , 2.7 % -9.7 % ] ( P = .01 ) . In this study of 7 patients with lower limb amputations , inclusion of EMG signals and temporal gait information reduced classification error across ambulation modes and during transitions between ambulation modes . These preliminary findings , if confirmed , have the potential to improve the control of powered leg prostheses .\",\n",
       " ' To measure choroidal thickness on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD OCT ) images using automated algorithms and to correlate choroidal pathology with retinal changes attributable to diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . Post hoc analysis of multicenter clinical trial baseline data . SD OCT raster scans/fluorescein angiograms were obtained from 284 treatment-nave eyes of 142 patients with clinically significant DME and from 20 controls . Three-dimensional ( 3D ) SD OCT images were evaluated by a certified independent reading center analyzing retinal changes associated with diabetic retinopathy . Choroidal thicknesses were analyzed using a fully automated algorithm . Angiograms were assessed manually . Multiple endpoint correction according to Bonferroni-Holm was applied . Main outcome measures were average retinal/choroidal thickness on fovea-centered or peak of edema ( thickest point of edema ) - centered Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid , maximum area of leakage , and the correlation between retinal and choroidal thicknesses . Total choroidal thickness is significantly reduced in DME ( 175 23 m ; P = .0016 ) and nonedematous fellow eyes ( 177 20 m ; P = .009 ) of patients compared with healthy control eyes ( 190 23 m ) . Retinal/choroidal thickness values showed no significant correlation ( 1-mm : P = .27 , r ( 2 ) = 0.01 ; 3-mm : P = .96 , r ( 2 ) < 0.0001 ; 6-mm : P = .42 , r ( 2 ) = 0.006 ) . No significant difference was found in the 1 - or 3-mm circle of a retinal peak of edema-centered grid . All other measurements of choroidal/retinal thickness ( DME vs healthy , DME vs peak of edema-centered , DME vs fellow , healthy vs fellow , peak of edema-centered vs healthy , peak of edema-centered vs fellow eyes ) were compared but no statistically significant correlation was found . By tendency a thinner choroid correlates with larger retinal leakage areas . Automated algorithms can be used to reliably assess choroidal thickness in eyes with DME . Choroidal thickness was generally reduced in patients with diabetes if DME is present in 1 eye ; however , no correlation was found between choroidal/retinal pathologies , suggesting different pathogenetic pathways .',\n",
       " ' This update of a randomized , prospective study presents the effect of external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) on long-term overall survival , local control , and limb function following limb-sparing surgery ( LSS ) for the treatment extremity soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) . Following LSS , patients with extremity STS were randomized to receive EBRT or surgery alone . All patients with high-grade STS received adjuvant chemotherapy . Long-term follow-up was obtained through telephone interviews using a questionnaire based on validated methods . Overall survival ( OS ) was determined by Kaplan-Meier method . A total of 141 patients with extremity STS were randomized to receive adjuvant EBRT ( n = 70 ) or LSS alone ( n = 71 ) . Median follow-up was 17.9 years . The 10 - and 20-year survival was 77 % ( 95 % CI 66-85 % ) and 64 % ( 95 % CI 52-75 % ) for patients receiving LSS alone and 82 % ( 95 % CI 72-90 % ) and 71 % ( 95 % CI 59-81 % ) for patients receiving EBRT ( p = 0.22 ) . Of the 54 patients who completed telephone interviews , the incidence of local recurrence during the follow-up period was 4 % ( 1 of 24 ) in the LSS alone cohort compared with 0 % ( 0 of 30 ) in those who received EBRT ( p = 0.44 ) . Patients treated with EBRT tended to have more wound complications ( 17 vs. 12.5 % , p = 0.72 ) , clinically significant edema ( 25 vs. 12 % , p = 0.31 ) , and functional limb deficits ( 15 vs. 12 % , p = 0.84 ) . Adjuvant EBRT following surgery for STS of the extremity provides excellent local control with acceptable treatment-related morbidity and no statistically significant improvement in overall survival .',\n",
       " ' In this pilot study we evaluated the feasibility of and methods for assessing the quality of life of long term survivors of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) phase III clinical trials . Here we report the results pertaining to the feasibility of conducting such research . In this cross-sectional study , we recruited long-term , disease-free survivors from two mature EORTC clinical trials in testicular and prostate cancer from centres in Northern and Southern Europe , and the United Kingdom ( UK ) . A number of challenges were encountered in recruiting participating centres , obtaining medical ethical approval and in recruiting survivors and collecting the health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) data in a timely manner . The efficiency with which the study could be conducted varied widely across centres and countries . Time to obtain medical ethical approval for the study ranged from 1.5 to 25 months . We encountered most problems with ethical approval in the UK , Italy and Belgium . In most cases , data collection was completed within 3 months ( range 10 weeks-1 year ) . Completed questionnaires were obtained from 68 % and 56 % , respectively , of the testicular and prostate cancer survivors who were approached . HRQoL research among long-term survivors of EORTC phase III clinical trials is possible , but the process of ethical approval and data collection is a lengthy one . To minimise many of the logistical problems , long-term follow-up of patients should be an integral part of future clinical trials . Moreover , regulations governing medical ethical approval for clinical research within the EU should be carefully evaluated to facilitate long-term follow-up of cancer survivors in Europe .',\n",
       " ' The serum collection under the abdominal flap is the most common complication after a lipo-abdominoplasty . The frequency of seroma increases further among obese patients , who have achieved massive weight loss after bariatric surgery . The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of fibrin glues with a low concentration of thrombin in reducing seroma formation after a lipo-abdominoplasty . Thirty patients , that had achieved a significant weight loss after an intervention of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) , underwent a circular lipo-abdominoplasty at our bariatric surgery department . Patients were divided into two groups of 15 subjects each : group A underwent traditional surgery ; in group B , we applied a slow-clotting variant of fibrin glue ( ARTISS , Baxter ) under the abdominal flap . All subjects were evaluated clinically using an ultrasound device on postoperative day 15 . We considered positive for seroma , those cases with a liquid collection greater than 20 cc . The groups were homogeneous for age , BMI , male/female ratio , and diabetic or smoker patients . The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in group A than in group B. We found eight cases of serum collection > 20 cc in group A and only one case in group B. Hematoma , umbilicus necrosis , and surgical site infection occurred in both groups , but overall complication rate was lower in group B. The use of a fibrin glue with a low concentration of thrombin could be useful during wound closure and may decrease seroma formation in postbariatric patients undergoing lipo-abdominoplasty .',\n",
       " ' Children with pulmonary hypertension routinely undergo pulmonary vascular resistance studies to assess the disease severity and vasodilator responsiveness . It is vital that results are accurate and reliable and are not influenced by the choice of anaesthetic agent . However , there are anecdotal data to suggest that propofol and inhalational agents have different effects on pulmonary vascular resistance . A total of 10 children with pulmonary hypertension were selected sequentially to be included in the study . To avoid confounding because of baseline anatomic or demographic details , a crossover protocol was implemented , using propofol or isoflurane , with time for washout in between each agent and blinding of the interventionalist . Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance were not significantly different when using propofol or isoflurane . However , the calculated resistance fraction - ratio of pulmonary resistance to systemic resistance - was significantly lower when using propofol than when using isoflurane . Although no difference in pulmonary vascular resistance was demonstrated , this pilot study suggests that the choice of anaesthetic agent may affect the calculation of relative pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance , and provides some preliminary evidence to favour propofol over isoflurane . These findings require replication in a larger study , and thus they should be considered in future calculations to make informed decisions about the management of children with pulmonary hypertension .',\n",
       " ' Dirofilaria repens is the causative agent of subcutaneous dirofilariosis of dogs , other animals and humans . This nematode is transmitted by mosquitoes of Aedes , Anopheles and Culex genera . In dogs , the parasite may cause subclinical infection or cutaneous signs . Recently , D. repens has emerged and spread in different geographical areas , with an increase of cases in dogs and humans . Chemoprevention in dogs in endemic areas is the most reliable approach for controlling this infection . This paper describes a randomized , blocked and multicentric clinical field study investigating the efficacy of an oral , chewable formulation containing milbemycin oxime/praziquantel ( Milbemax , Novartis Animal Health ) in the chemoprevention of subcutaneous dirofilariosis in dogs . This study was conducted in endemic areas of Italy . A total of 249 dogs , at two sites , negative for D. repens , were allocated into two groups ( i.e. Treated - T1 vs Untreated-T2 ) with a ratio of 1:1 , and subjected to clinical visits and blood sampling once monthly until the end of the study . All blood samples were microscopically and genetically examined . Animals belonging to T1 group received a minimum target dose of 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight of milbemycin oxime and 5 mg/kg of praziquantel in commercial tablets ( Milbemax ) according body weight once every 4 weeks . Animals of group T2 were not treated with Milbemax but received , when necessary , specific parasiticide treatments . The study duration was 336 2 days for each dog . A total of 219 dogs completed the study ( i.e. 111 in T1 and 108 in T2 ) , while 30 dogs ( i.e. 13 in T1 , 17 in T2 ) were withdrawn for a variety of reasons unrelated to administration of Milbemax . The percentages of animals not showing microfilariae of D. repens were 100 % ( 111 animals ) in T1 and 94.7 % ( 108 animals out of 114 ) in group T2 . Milbemax was shown to be safe in treated dogs . The results of this study confirm that the monthly use of Milbemax in dogs is effective and safe for the prevention of subcutaneous dirofilariosis in endemic areas .',\n",

Ninety-six patients scheduled for upper limb surgery were randomly elicited a medial or posterior cord response for infraclavicular block using 40 mL of 0.5 % ropivacaine . We assessed block success ( complete sensory block of the 5 nerves in the forearm at 50 minutes ) as the primary end point and block procedure characteristics and adverse events as secondary end points . The block success rates did not differ significantly between medial and posterior cord stimulation ( 95.7 % [ 44/46 ] vs 91.7 % [ 44/48 ] , 95 % CI of difference , -7.4 % to 15.6 % ) , while the secondary end points were comparable in both groups .

       " ' Pharmacokinetically guided ( PK-guided ) versus body surface area-based 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) dosing results in higher response rates and better tolerability . A paucity of data exists on PK-guided 5-FU dosing in the community setting . Seventy colorectal cancer patients , from one academic and five community cancer centers , received the mFOLFOX6 regimen ( 5-FU 2,400 mg/m ( 2 ) over 46 hours every 2 weeks ) with or without bevacizumab at cycle 1 . The 5-FU continuous-infusion dose was adjusted for cycles 2-4 using a PK-guided algorithm to achieve a literature-based target area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) . The primary objective was to demonstrate that PK-guided 5-FU dosing improves the ability to achieve a target AUC within four cycles of therapy . The secondary objective was to demonstrate reduced incidence of 5-FU-related toxicities . At cycles 1 and 4 , 27.7 % and 46.8 % of patients achieved the target AUC ( 20-25 mg hour/L ) , respectively ( odds ratio [ OR ] : 2.20 ; p = .046 ) . Significantly more patients were within range at cycle 4 compared with a literature rate of 20 % ( p < .0001 ) . Patients had significantly higher odds of not being underdosed at cycle 4 versus cycle 1 ( OR : 2.29 ; p = .037 ) . The odds of a patient being within range increased by 30 % at each subsequent cycle ( OR : 1.30 ; p = .03 ) . Less grade 3/4 mucositis and diarrhea were observed compared with historical data ( 1.9 % vs 16 % and 5.6 % vs 12 % , respectively ) ; however , rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia were similar ( 33 % vs 25 % -50 % ) . PK-guided 5-FU dosing resulted in significantly fewer underdosed patients and less gastrointestinal toxicity and allows for the application of personalized colorectal cancer therapy in the community setting .',\n",
       " ' To assess the side effects unrelated to disease activity and the acceptability of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) , progestin-only pills ( POPs ) and copper-releasing intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) in women with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . A randomized clinical trial including 162 women with SLE , assigned to COC ( n = 54 ) , POP ( n = 54 ) or IUD ( n = 54 ) . Follow-up visits were conducted after 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months of treatment to monitor the presence of symptoms , changes in body weight and blood pressure as well as the development of health problems other than those relating to lupus . Reasons for discontinuation and satisfaction with the use of the assigned method were recorded at the end of treatment . Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics , repeated measure analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves . Significantly different discontinuation rates due to any reason [ 35 % , 55 % , 29 % ( p < 0.01 ) ] or nonmedical reasons [ ( 11 % , 31 % , 4 % ( p < 0.05 ) ] were observed among the COC , POP and IUD groups . Nausea was most frequent among COC users , dysmenorrhea among IUD users and acne and hirsutism among POP users . Mean blood pressures remained unchanged . Mild increases in body weight were observed over time in all treatment groups . Most women were satisfied with the use of the assigned contraceptive method . Oral contraceptives and IUD are acceptable birth control methods for patients with lupus , when counseling and specialized health attention are provided ; however , the acceptability of POP appears to be inferior . Side effects unrelated to lupus disease activity are not frequent reasons to discontinue the contraceptive methods . This study delves into an area that has not been explored among patients with lupus . Our findings on the associated side effects and reasons for discontinuing COCs , POPs or copper-bearing IUDs may be useful in improving contraceptive counseling for women with lupus . Furthermore , they also heighten our knowledge on the reasons that may preclude the widespread use of effective contraceptives among lupus patients .',\n",
       " ' Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a frequent concern when treating solar lentigines . To assess the safety and efficacy of a triple combination cream with fluocinolone acetonide 0.01 % , hydroquinone 4 % and tretinoin 0.05 % as adjuvant to cryotherapy in the treatment of solar lentigines in hands dorsum , and in the prevention of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation after cryotherapy . This prospective , randomized , controlled , investigator-blinded , single-centre study enrolled 50 patients . Twenty-five patients received a 2-week daily triple combination cream plus sunscreen pre-treatment and 25 received sunscreen alone . After that , cryotherapy was performed in all patients followed by a 3-week recovery period . After this period , patients received the same initial treatment and were followed up for 8weeks . Melanin and erythema levels of a target and a control lentigo were objectively measured using a narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer . Lentigines count , colour homogeneity and global improvement were also assessed . The number of solar lentigines reduced in the first 2weeks only in patients who used the triple combination 257 vs. 228 ( P < 0.0001 ) , and reduced at the end of the study for both groups ( P < 0.0001 ) . The melanin levels also reduced in the first 2weeks only in patients who used the triple combination 29769 vs. 27366 ( P < 0.0001 ) and reduced at the end of the study for both groups ( P < 0.0001 ) . Erythema and residual blisters from cryotherapy were the reported adverse reactions . Triple combination cream can be used to enhance the resolution of solar lentigines , and to significantly reduce melanin levels and lentigines count , improving treatment results . It was well-tolerated and did not increase the occurrence of neither erythema nor other side-effects after the cryotherapy .',\n",

       " ' Triage of HPV screen-positive women is needed to identify those with underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or worse ( CIN2/3 + ) . Presently , cytology on a physician-taken cervical scrape is mostly accepted as triage test , but needs follow-up testing in order not to miss severe disease . Here , we evaluated the performance of combined cytology and bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis as triage test on physician-taken cervical scrapes of HPV positive women . In this post-hoc analysis , we used 364 left-over HPV positive cytology triage samples of participants of a randomized controlled trial ( PROHTECT-3 : n = 46,001 ) performed in population-based cervical screening . Study endpoints were CIN2 + and CIN3 + detection . Cytology testing with and without methylation marker analysis was evaluated with regard to sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive value , and referral rate . Bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation positivity increased proportionally with severity of underlying lesions . Overall , cytology and bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis yielded similar performances with regard to CIN3 + detection , yet in combination a significantly higher sensitivity for CIN3 + ( 88.7 % ) was obtained at a specificity of 53.6 % and a colposcopy referral rate of 53.6 % . The combined strategy detected all six cervical cancers , whereas triage by cytology alone failed to detect two of them . Cytology and bi-marker CADM1/MAL-methylation analysis perform complementary for CIN2 + / CIN3 + detection when used as triage tool on cervical scrapes of HPV positive women . This approach not only results in a higher CIN3 + sensitivity than cytology triage with an acceptable referral rate , but also seems to reduce the risk of missing cervical cancers and advanced high-grade lesions .',\n",
       " ' The analgesic efficacy of the transversus abdominis plane peripheral nerve block following abdominal tissue breast reconstruction has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial . The authors conducted a double-blind , placebo-controlled , 1:1 allocation , two-arm parallel group , superiority design , randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing microsurgical abdominally based breast reconstruction . Intraoperatively , epidural catheters were inserted under direct vision through the triangle of Petit on both sides of the abdomen into the transversus abdominis plane just before rectus fascial closure . Patients received either bupivacaine ( study group ) or saline ( placebo group ) through the catheters for 2 postoperative days . All patients received hydromorphone by means of a patient-controlled analgesic pump . The primary outcome was the difference in the parenteral opioid consumption on each postoperative day between the groups . The secondary outcome measures included the following : total in-hospital opioid ; antinausea medication ; pain , nausea , and sedation scores ; Quality of Recovery Score ; time to ambulation ; and hospital stay duration . Between September of 2011 and June of 2013 , 93 patients were enrolled : 49 received bupivacaine and 44 received saline . There were 11 postoperative complications ( 13 percent ) ; none were related to the catheter . Primary outcomes were completed by 85 of 93 patients ( 91.3 percent ) ; the mean parenteral morphine consumption was significantly reduced on postoperative day 1 in the bupivacaine group ( 20.720.1 mg ) compared with 30.019.1 mg in the control group ( p = 0.02 ) . There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes . Following abdominally based breast reconstruction , transversus abdominis plane peripheral nerve block is safe and significantly reduces morphine consumption in the early postoperative period .

       " ' The aim of this study was to comparatively examine the convenience of use of the QUEST and GerdQ questionnaires as self-administered diagnostic instruments . This was a two-way crossover study conducted from December 2011 to April 2012 . The subjects were 70 third-year nursing students of Yokohama Soei University in Yokohama , Japan . They were randomly assigned to fill in either of the study questionnaires first , and then the other on a later . A significant difference was observed in the questionnaire completion time between the QUEST and GerdQ questionnaires ( 125.5 vs. 44 seconds , P < 0.0001 ) and also in the number of subjects asking questions while completing the questionnaires ( 26 vs. 1 subject , respectively : P < 0.0001 ) . To detect GERD based on a QUEST score of 4 , ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve for the GerdQ score of 0.616 . The optimal cutoff value of the GerdQ score was 6 , and the sensitivity and specificity calculated using this cutoff value were 0.842 and 0.312 , respectively . This study revealed that Japanese subjects may find it easier to complete the GerdQ than the QUEST questionnaire .',\n",
       " ' Prevention of iron deficiency in infancy may promote neurodevelopment . Delayed cord clamping ( DCC ) can prevent iron deficiency during the first 6 months of life . However , no data are available on long-term effects on infant outcomes in relation to time for umbilical cord clamping . To investigate effects of DCC , as compared with early cord clamping ( ECC ) , on infant iron status and neurodevelopment at age 12 months in a European setting . Randomized clinical trial of 382 full-term infants born after a low-risk pregnancy at a Swedish county hospital . Follow-up at 12 months included evaluation of iron status ( ferritin level , transferrin saturation , transferrin receptor level , reticulocyte hemoglobin level , and mean cell volume ) and parental assessment of neurodevelopment by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire , second edition ( ASQ ) . Infants were randomized to DCC ( 180 seconds after delivery ) or ECC ( 10 seconds after delivery ) . The main outcome was iron status at age 12 months ; the secondary outcome was ASQ score . In total , 347 of 382 infants ( 90.8 % ) were assessed . The DCC and ECC groups did not differ in iron status ( mean ferritin level , 35.4 vs 33.6 ng/mL , respectively ; P = .40 ) or neurodevelopment ( mean ASQ total score , 229.6 vs 233.1 , respectively ; P = .42 ) at age 12 months . Predictors of ferritin levels were infant sex and ferritin in umbilical cord blood . Predictors of ASQ score were infant sex and breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth . For both outcomes , being a boy was associated with lower results . Interaction analysis showed that DCC was associated with an ASQ score 5 points higher among boys ( mean [ SD ] score , 229 [ 43 ] for DCC vs 224 [ 39 ] for ECC ) but 12 points lower among girls ( mean [ SD ] score , 230 [ 39 ] for DCC vs 242 [ 36 ] for ECC ) , out of a maximum of 300 points ( P = .04 for the interaction term ) . Delayed cord clamping did not affect iron status or neurodevelopment at age 12 months in a selected population of healthy term-born infants . However , it may not be possible to demonstrate minor effects on neurodevelopment with the size of the study population and the chosen method for assessment . The current data indicate that sex may influence the effects on infant development after DCC in different directions . The magnitude and biological reason for this finding remain to be investigated .

       " ' Dacomitinib is an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine-kinase inhibitor with preclinical and clinical evidence of activity in non-small-cell lung cancer . We designed BR .26 to assess whether dacomitinib improved overall survival in heavily pretreated patients with this disease . In this double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , phase 3 trial , we enrolled adults ( aged 18 years ) with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer from 75 centres in 12 countries . Eligible patients had received up to three previous lines of chemotherapy and either gefitinib or erlotinib , and had assessable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) and tumour tissue samples for translational studies . Patients were stratified according to centre , performance status , tobacco use , best response to previous EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor , weight loss within the previous 3 months , and ethnicity , and were then randomly allocated 2:1 to oral dacomitinib 45 mg once-daily or matched placebo centrally via a web-based system . Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . The primary outcome was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population ; secondary outcomes included overall survival in predefined molecular subgroups , progression-free survival , the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response , safety , and quality of life . This study is completed , although follow-up is ongoing for patients on treatment . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01000025 . Between Dec 23 , 2009 , and June 11 , 2013 , we randomly assigned 480 patients to dacomitinib and 240 patients to placebo . At the final analysis ( January , 2014 ) , median follow-up was 234 months ( IQR 156-296 ) for patients in the dacomitinib group and 244 months ( 115-389 ) for those in the placebo group . Dacomitinib did not improve overall survival compared with placebo ( median 683 months [ 95 % CI 608-749 ] for dacomitinib vs 631 months [ 532-752 ] for placebo ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 100 [ 95 % CI 083-121 ] ; p = 0506 ) .

       " \" Treatment for CH-C contains interferon with substantial associated side effects and health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) impairment . Currently , there is no published data assessing the impact of interferon-free regimens on HRQL . The aim is to report the HRQL of patients who participated in clinical trials of sofosbuvir ( SOF ) for CH-C . CH-C patients were treated with sofosbuvir ( SOF ) , pegylated interferon ( PegIFN ) , ribavirin ( RBV ) , or placebo in different combinations and duration ( POSITRON , FISSION , FUSION , and NEUTRINO phase III trials ) . HRQL was assessed using SF-36 at baseline , during treatment , at the end of treatment , and at follow-up , and compared between treatment arms . HRQL scores decreased over the course of treatment for all treatment arms in all studies ; however , patients returned to their baseline score by the end of follow-up . Compared to placebo , SOF and RBV was not associated with HRQL impairment ( POSITRON ) . Compared to SOF and RBV , HRQL was significantly more impaired in the PegIFN and RBV arm ( FISSION ) . For those treated with SOF and RBV , there was no difference in HRQL between 12 weeks or 16 weeks of treatment ( FUSION ) . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that depression , fatigue , and insomnia were important predictors of patients ' HRQL prior , during or after treatment . Additionally , anemia and receiving interferon were predictors of HRQL impairment during treatment . Achieving sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of follow-up ( SVR-12 ) with SOF and RBV was associated with improvement in HRQL scores from baseline . Treatment-related HRQL impairment during SOF and RBV regimen is mild , and does not increase with longer treatment duration . Achieving SVR-12 with SOF and RBV is associated with an improvement in HRQL .\",\n",

Knowledge surveys about FASD have been conducted with various health and allied healthcare providers and have proven useful in identifying gaps in knowledge and differences among provider groups to support prevention efforts . To date , no research has been conducted exploring FASD knowledge among college students . This study explored FASD knowledge in a sample of college students , a group at particularly high risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies . Findings are compared to professionals in several healthcare and affiliated professional groups who were previously surveyed with the same FASD-related items . Surveys from 1,035 college students at a northwestern university were analyzed . Included with the ACHA-National College Health Assessment II were questions regarding FASD . College students ' knowledge was compared with that of professionals in key healthcare and affiliated positions to define their relative awareness of FASD risk . Overall , findings revealed adequate FASD knowledge among college students . Although minor differences emerged when comparing students and professionals ' responses , most respondent groups answered with an 85 % accuracy rate or higher . College students demonstrated adequate knowledgeable about FASD . Future research must explore whether such knowledge translates into lower risk behavior and consequent reduction in alcohol-exposed pregnancies .\",\n",
       " ' High - and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS ) has been shown to be beneficial for upper limb hemiparesis in patients with acute stroke . However , no study has examined the usefulness of bilateral application of HF - and LF-rTMS ( BL-rTMS ) . Fifty-eight hemiparetic patients with acute stroke were randomly assigned into two groups : HF-rTMS group and BL-rTMS group . All patients were scheduled to receive five sessions of either HF-rTMS over the lesional hemisphere or BL-rTMS over both hemispheres for 5 days . Motor function of the affected upper limb was evaluated using the Brunnstrom Recovery Stage ( BRS ) for upper-limb and hand-fingers , grip strength and tapping frequency , before the first session and after the last session of rTMS . Improvement of BRS for the upper limb and hand/finger was significantly greater in the BL-rTMS group than the HF-rTMS group ( p < 0.01 ) . Improvement in grip strength and tapping frequency was also greater in the BL-rTMS group , although the differences were not statistically significant . The proposed BL-rTMS is safe and feasible and showed a greater improvement of BRS of the affected upper limb compared to HF-rTMS . This novel rTMS approach may be a useful intervention for hemiparetic patients with acute stroke .',\n",
       " \" The evaluation of intestinal trophism , mainly the mucosal layer , is an important issue in various conditions associated with injury , atrophy , recovery , and healing of the gut . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of the proliferation and apoptosis of enterocytes by immunohistochemistry and to assess the complexity of intestinal mucosa by fractal dimension ( FD ) analysis in Solea solea fed different experimental diets . Histomorphological evaluation of all intestinal segments did not show signs of degeneration or inflammation . Cell proliferation index and FD were significantly reduced with a diet high in mussel meal ( MM ; p = 0.0034 and p = 0.01063 , respectively ) , while apoptotic index did not show any significant difference for the same comparison ( p = 0.3859 ) . Linear regression analysis between apoptotic index ( independent variable ) and FD ( dependent variable ) showed a statistically significant inverse relationship ( p = 0.002528 ) . Linear regression analysis between cell proliferation index ( independent variable ) and FD ( dependent variable ) did not show any significant correlation ( p = 0.131582 ) . The results demonstrated that diets containing increasing levels of mussel meal in substitution of fishmeal did not incite a hyperplastic response of the intestinal mucosa . The mussel meal , which is derived from molluscs , could mimic the characteristics of the sole 's natural prey , being readily digestible , even without increasing the absorptive surface of intestinal mucosa . Interestingly , from this study emerged that FD could be used as a numeric indicator complementary to in situ quantification methods to measure intestinal trophism , in conjunction with functional parameters .\",\n",

To examine whether DCS augments the effects of CBT for OCD and to explore ( post hoc ) whether concomitant antidepressant medication moderates the effects of DCS . A 12-week , double-blind randomized clinical trial with 3-month follow-up conducted at an academic medical center between September 4 , 2012 , and September 26 , 2013 . Participants included 128 adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of OCD and a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) score of 16 or higher . Concurrent antidepressant medication was permitted if the dose had been stable for at least 2 months prior to enrollment and remained unchanged during the trial . The main analysis was by intention-to-treat population . All participants received a previously validated Internet-based CBT protocol over 12 weeks and were randomized to receive either 50 mg of DCS or placebo , administered 1 hour before each of 5 exposure and response prevention tasks . Clinician-administered Y-BOCS score at week 12 and at 3-month follow-up . Remission was defined as a score of 12 or lower on the Y-BOCS . In the primary intention-to-treat analyses , DCS did not augment the effects of CBT compared with placebo ( mean [ SD ] clinician-rated Y-BOCS score , DCS : 13.86 [ 6.50 ] at week 12 and 12.35 [ 7.75 ] at 3-month follow-up ; placebo : 11.77 [ 5.95 ] at week 12 and 12.37 [ 6.68 ] at 3-month follow-up ) but showed a significant interaction with antidepressants ( clinician-rated Y-BOCS , B = -1.08 ; Z = -2.79 ; P = .005 ) . Post hoc analyses revealed that antidepressants significantly impaired treatment response in the DCS group but not the placebo group , at both posttreatment and follow-up ( clinician-rated Y-BOCS : t62 = -3.00 ; P = .004 ; and t61 = -3.49 ; P < .001 , respectively ) . In the DCS group , a significantly greater proportion of antidepressant-free patients achieved remission status at follow-up ( 60 % [ 95 % CI , 45 % -74 % ] ) than antidepressant-medicated patients ( 24 % [ 95 % CI , 9 % -48 % ] ) ( P = .008 ) .

We tested the effects of half-molar sodium lactate infusion on cardiac performance in AHF . We conducted a prospective , randomised , controlled , open-label , pilot clinical trial in 40 patients fulfilling two of the following three criteria for AHF : ( 1 ) left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % , ( 2 ) acute pulmonary oedema or respiratory failure of predominantly cardiac origin requiring mechanical ventilation and ( 3 ) currently receiving vasopressor and/or inotropic support . Patients in the intervention group received a 3 ml/kg bolus of half-molar sodium lactate over the course of 15 minutes followed by 1 ml/kg/h continuous infusion for 24 hours . The control group received only a 3 ml/kg bolus of Hartmann 's solution without continuous infusion . The primary outcome was CO assessed by transthoracic echocardiography 24 hours after randomisation . Secondary outcomes included a measure of right ventricular systolic function ( tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE ) ) , acid-base balance , electrolyte and organ function parameters , along with length of stay and mortality . The infusion of half-molar sodium lactate increased ( meanSD ) CO from 4.051.37 L/min to 5.491.9 L/min ( P < 0.01 ) and TAPSE from 14.75.5 mm to 18.37 mm ( P = 0.02 ) .

FXI-ASO ( ISIS 416858 ) is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide that specifically reduces factor XI levels . We compared the efficacy and safety of FXI-ASO with those of enoxaparin in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty . In this open-label , parallel-group study , we randomly assigned 300 patients who were undergoing elective primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty to receive one of two doses of FXI-ASO ( 200 mg or 300 mg ) or 40 mg of enoxaparin once daily . The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( assessed by mandatory bilateral venography or report of symptomatic events ) . The principal safety outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding . Around the time of surgery , the mean ( SE ) factor XI levels were 0.380.01 units per milliliter in the 200-mg FXI-ASO group , 0.200.01 units per milliliter in the 300-mg FXI-ASO group , and 0.930.02 units per milliliter in the enoxaparin group . The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 36 of 134 patients ( 27 % ) who received the 200-mg dose of FXI-ASO and in 3 of 71 patients ( 4 % ) who received the 300-mg dose of FXI-ASO , as compared with 21 of 69 patients ( 30 % ) who received enoxaparin . The 200-mg regimen was noninferior , and the 300-mg regimen was superior , to enoxaparin ( P < 0.001 ) . Bleeding occurred in 3 % , 3 % , and 8 % of the patients in the three study groups , respectively .

Therefore the TRPV1 receptor is an attractive target for the development of antitussive agents . We sought to assess the antitussive effect of TRPV1 antagonism in patients with refractory chronic cough . Twenty-one subjects with refractory chronic cough ( > 8 weeks ) attending a specialist clinic were recruited to a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial assessing a TRPV1 antagonist ( SB-705498 ) . Cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin ( concentration of capsaicin inducing at least 5 coughs ) and 24-hour cough frequency were coprimary end points assessed after a single dose of SB-705498 ( 600 mg ) and matched placebo . Cough severity and urge to cough were reported on visual analog scales , and cough-specific quality of life data were also collected . Treatment with SB-705498 produced a significant improvement in cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin at 2 hours and a borderline significant improvement at 24 hours compared with placebo ( adjusted mean difference of +1.3 doubling doses at 2 hours [ 95 % CI , +0.3 to +2.2 ; P = .0049 ] and +0.7 doubling doses at 24 hours [ 95 % CI , +0.0 to +1.5 ; P = .0259 ] ) . However , 24-hour objective cough frequency was not improved compared with placebo . Patient-reported cough severity , urge to cough , and cough-specific quality of life similarly suggested no effect of SB-705498 . This study raises important questions about both the role of TRVP1-mediated mechanisms in patients with refractory chronic cough and also the predictive value of capsaicin challenge testing in the assessment of novel antitussive agents .',\n",

The objective of this study is to evaluate if WM training is effective in improving cognitive function in elderly patients with MCI , and if cognitive training induces structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain , as assessed by structural MRI . The proposed study is a blinded , randomized , controlled trail that will include 90 elderly patients diagnosed with MCI at a hospital-based memory clinic . The participants will be randomized to either a training program or a placebo version of the program . The intervention is computerized WM training performed for 45minutes of 25 sessions over 5weeks . The placebo version is identical in duration but is non-adaptive in the difficulty level of the tasks . Neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI will be performed before and 1 month after training , and at a 5-month folllow-up . If computer-based training results in positive changes to memory functions in patients with MCI this may represent a new , cost-effective treatment for MCI . Secondly , evaluation of any training-induced structural changes to gray or white matter will improve the current understanding of the mechanisms behind effective cognitive interventions in patients with MCI .

Effectiveness of CGM is directly linked with CGM adherence , which can be challenging to maintain in children and adolescents . We hypothesize that initiating CGM at the same time as starting insulin pump therapy in pump nave children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes will result in greater CGM adherence and effectiveness compared to delaying CGM introduction by 6 months , and that this is related to greater readiness for making behaviour change at the time of pump initiation . The CGM TIME Trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial . Eligible children and adolescents ( 5-18 years ) with established type 1 diabetes were randomized to simultaneous initiation of pump ( Medtronic Veo ) and CGM ( Enlite ) or to standard pump therapy with delayed CGM introduction . Primary outcomes are CGM adherence and hemoglobin A1C at 6 and 12 months post pump initiation . Secondary outcomes include glycemic variability , stage of readiness , and other patient-reported outcomes with follow-up to 24 months . 144 ( 95 % ) of the 152 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized . Allowing for 10 % withdrawals , this will provide 93 % power to detect a between group difference in CGM adherence and 86 % power to detect a between group difference in hemoglobin A1C .

       " ' In assessing quality of care in developing countries , retrospectively collected data are usually used given their availability . Retrospective data however suffer from such biases as recall bias and non-response bias . Comparing results obtained using prospectively and retrospectively collected data will help validate the use of the easily available retrospective data in assessing quality of care in past and future studies . Prospective and retrospective datasets were obtained from a cluster randomized trial of a multifaceted intervention aimed at improving paediatric inpatient care conducted in eight rural Kenyan district hospitals by improving management of children admitted with pneumonia , malaria and diarrhea and/or dehydration . Four hospitals received a full intervention and four a partial intervention . Data were collected through 3 two weeks surveys conducted at baseline , after 6 and 18 months . Retrospective data was sampled from paediatric medical records of patients discharged in the preceding six months of the survey while prospective data was collected from patients discharged during the two week period of each survey . Risk Differences during post-intervention period of 16 quality of care indicators were analyzed separately for prospective and retrospective datasets and later plotted side by side for comparison . For the prospective data there was strong evidence of an intervention effect for 8 of the indicators and weaker evidence of an effect for one indicator , with magnitude of effect sizes varying from 23 % to 60 % difference . For the retrospective data , 10 process ( these include the 8 indicators found to be statistically significant in prospective data analysis ) indicators had statistically significant differences with magnitude of effects varying from 10 % to 42 % . The bar-graph comparing results from the prospective and retrospective datasets showed similarity in terms of magnitude of effects and statistical significance for all except two indicators . Multifaceted interventions can help improve adoption of clinical guidelines and hence improve the quality of care . The similar inference reached after analyses based on prospective assessment of case management is a useful finding as it supports the utility of work based on examination of retrospectively assembled case records allowing longer time periods to be studied while constraining costs .

       " ' Poor patient understanding of their diagnosis and treatment plan can adversely impact clinical outcome following hospital discharge . Discharge summaries are primarily written for the doctor rather than the patient . We determined patient understanding of the reasons for hospitalisation , in-hospital tests , treatments and post-discharge recommendations , and whether a brief patient-directed discharge letter ( PADDLE ) delivered during a brief discussion prior to discharge would improve understanding . A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted , including 67 hospitalised patients . After a baseline questionnaire , patients were randomised to receive the PADDLE letter or usual care . Those receiving the letter had an immediate follow-up questionnaire . Patient understanding was compared with a summary letter written by the treating clinician , using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from none to full understanding . A questionnaire was administered at 3 and 6 months . At baseline , patients had almost full understanding ( median score 4 ) of reasons for hospitalisation and treatments . However , despite high self-appraisal , patients objectively had very little understanding of tests performed and post-discharge recommendations ( median 2 ) . Those receiving the letter had an immediate increase to almost full understanding ( median 4 ) of tests performed ( P < 0.001 ) and to full understanding ( median 5 ) of post-discharge recommendations . This increase did not persist at 3 or 6 months . A simple patient-directed letter delivered during a brief discussion improves patient understanding of their hospitalisation and post-discharge recommendations , which is otherwise limited . Further evaluation of this brief and well-received intervention is indicated , with the goal of improving patient understanding , satisfaction and clinical outcomes .',\n",
       " \" Patient reported outcome measures ( PROMs ) are used to evaluate lifestyle interventions but little is known about differences between patients returning valid and invalid responses , or of potential for bias in evaluations . We aimed to examine the characteristics of patients who returned valid responses to lifestyle questionnaires compared to those whose responses were invalid for evaluating lifestyle change . We conducted a secondary data analysis from the SPHERE Study , a trial of an intervention to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease in primary care . Postal questionnaires were used to assess physical activity ( Godin ) and diet ( DINE ) among study participants at baseline and 18 month follow-up . Three binary response variables were generated for analysis : ( 1 ) valid Godin score ; ( 2 ) valid DINE Fibre score ; and ( 3 ) valid DINE Total Fat score . Multivariate analysis comprised generalised estimating equation regression to examine the association of patients ' characteristics with their return of valid responses at both timepoints . Overall , 92.1 % of participants ( 832/903 ) returned questionnaires at both baseline and 18 months . Relatively fewer valid Godin scores were returned by those who left school aged < 15 years ( 36.5 % ) than aged 18 and over ( 50.5 % ) , manual workers ( 39.5 % ) than non-manual ( 49.5 % ) and those with an elevated cholesterol ( > 5 mmol ) ( 34.7 % ) than those with a lower cholesterol ( 44.4 % ) but multivariate analysis identified that only school leaving age ( p = 0.047 ) was of statistical significance.Relatively fewer valid DINE scores were returned by manual than non-manual workers ( fibre : 80.8 % v 86.8 % ; fat : 71.2 % v 80.0 % ) , smokers ( fibre : 72.6 % v 84.7 % ; fat : 67.5 % v 76.9 % ) , patients with diabetes ( fibre : 75.9 % v 82.9 % ; fat : 66.9 % v 75.8 % ) and those with cholesterol > 5 mmol ( fat : 68.2 % v 76.2 % ) but multivariate analysis showed statistical significance only for smoking ( fibre : p = 0.013 ; fat : p = 0.045 ) , diabetes ( fibre : p = 0.039 ; fat : p = 0.047 ) , and cholesterol ( fat : p = 0.039 ) . Our findings illustrate the importance of detailed reporting of research methods , with clear information about response rates , respondents and valid outcome data . Outcome measures which are relevant to a study population should be chosen carefully . The impact of methods of outcome measurement and valid response rates in evaluating healthcare requires further study .\",\n",
       " ' Previous studies have shown that a calcium ( Ca ) pre-rinse given before a 228 ppm fluoride ( F ) rinse greatly increased salivary fluoride . Objectives . The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine if Ca pre-rinse could increase the fluoride concentration in the overnight unstimulated saliva after a 905 ppm F-rinse . Pre-rinses containing 150 mM , 75 mM or 0 mM Ca-lactate prepared by a validated pharmaceutical cGPM procedure were tested by nine subjects in a randomized order immediately followed by a 905 ppm F-rinse . The fluoride concentration was measured in unstimulated saliva collected 10 h later . The Ca pre-treatment significantly increased F level in overnight saliva following the 905 ppm fluoride rinse by 1.7 relative to the 905 ppm F-rinse alone ; however , a significant effect was only observed with the highest ( 150 mM ) Ca concentration as pre-rinse . Clinical relevance . High concentration F rinses ( 905 ppm ) are commonly recommended for patients at high-risk of caries . A pre-treatment with high levels of Ca may further improve the cariostatic effect of this ion .',\n",
       " ' Social media sites , such as Facebook , merge two factors that influence risk for eating disorders : media and peers . Previous work has identified cross-sectional and temporal associations between Facebook use and disordered eating . This study sought to replicate and extend these findings using an experimental design . In Study 1 , 960 women completed self-report surveys regarding Facebook use and disordered eating . In Study 2 , 84 women were randomly assigned to use Facebook or to use an alternate internet site for 20 min . More frequent Facebook use was associated with greater disordered eating in a cross-sectional survey . Facebook use was associated with the maintenance of weight/shape concerns and state anxiety compared to an alternate internet activity . Facebook use may contribute to disordered eating by maintaining risk for eating pathology . As such , targeting Facebook use may be helpful in intervention and prevention programs .',\n",
       " ' Oritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic with rapid bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria . Its concentration-dependent activity and long half-life allow for single-dose treatment . In a randomized , double-blind trial , adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections ( ABSSSIs ) received either a single intravenous 1200-mg dose of oritavancin or 7-10 days of twice-daily vancomycin . Three efficacy endpoints were tested for noninferiority : ( 1 ) primary composite endpoint at 48-72 hours ( cessation of spreading or reduction in lesion size , absence of fever , and no rescue antibiotic ) ; ( 2 ) investigator-assessed clinical cure 7-14 days after end of treatment ; and ( 3 ) 20 % reduction in lesion area at 48-72 hours . A total of 503 and 502 patients comprised the modified intent-to-treat population for oritavancin and vancomycin , respectively . All 3 efficacy endpoints met the 10 % noninferiority margin : the primary composite endpoint ( 80.1 % vs 82.9 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -7.5 to 2.0 ) , investigator-assessed clinical cure ( 82.7 % vs 80.5 % ; 95 % CI , -2.6 to 7.0 ) , and proportion of patients attaining 20 % reduction in lesion area ( 85.9 % vs 85.3 % ; 95 % CI , -3.7 to 5.0 ) for oritavancin vs vancomycin , respectively . Efficacy outcomes by pathogen , including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the frequency of adverse events , were similar between treatment groups . A single 1200-mg dose of oritavancin was noninferior to 7-10 days of vancomycin in treating ABSSSIs caused by gram-positive pathogens , and was well tolerated . Oritavancin provides a single-dose alternative to multidose therapies for the treatment of ABSSSIs . Clinical Trials Registration . NCT01252732 .',\n",
       " ' To test a combination of dexamethasone intravitreal implant with macular grid laser for macular edema in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion ( BRVO ) . Prospective interventional , randomized , multicenter study . Patients with macular edema secondary to BRVO underwent an Ozurdex intravitreal implant at baseline . After 1 month , patients were randomly assigned to 2 study groups . Patients in Group 1 were followed up monthly and retreated with Ozurdex implant whenever there was a recurrence of macular edema or a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) . In Group 2 patients macular grid laser was performed between weeks 6 and 8 . After that , patients were followed up and retreated as for Group 1 . In Group 1 at 4 months , mean BCVA was 0.49 0.35 logMAR and central retinal thickness ( CRT ) was 391 172 m ; both improved significantly at 6 months , to 0.32 0.29 logMAR and 322 160 m , respectively . In Group 2 , CRT was reduced significantly to 291 76 m at 4 months , and BCVA improved to 0.25 0.20 logMAR . At the final visit , BCVA was 0.18 0.14 logMAR and mean CRT was 271 44 m. The number of Ozurdex implants at 4 months was 12 of 25 ( 48 % ) in Group 1 patients vs 3 of 25 ( 12 % ) in Group 2 patients ( P = .012 ) . At 6 months 3 of 25 patients ( 12 % ) in Group 1 vs 0 of 25 ( 0 % ) in Group 2 ( P = .23 ) were retreated .

       " ' Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is a progressive disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality . Current therapies improve symptoms , functional capacity , and , in select cases , survival . Little is known about patient factors that may predict the likelihood of patient-important , clinically relevant responses to therapy such as the 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) . Data from the randomized clinical trial of tadalafil in PAH were used . Adjusted logistic regression models were created to examine the relationship between baseline characteristics and odds of achieving the minimal important difference ( MID ) in three parameters , defined as either a > 33-m increase in 6MWD , a > 5-unit increase in physical component summary score of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , or a > 5-unit increase in mental component summary score of the SF-36 . The study included 405 subjects . Younger age , male sex , lower baseline 6MWD , and disease etiology were associated with greater odds of achieving the MID for the 6-min walk test . Active treatment , younger age , and male sex were associated with greater odds of achieving the MID for the physical component summary score . Male sex was associated with greater odds of achieving the MID for the mental component summary score . Age , sex , baseline functional capacity , and disease etiology are variably associated with the likelihood of achieving clinically relevant responses in patient-important outcomes to PAH-specific therapy such as 6MWD and HRQoL . The increased likelihood of response in men compared with women is a novel finding and may reflect pathophysiologic differences between sexes .',\n",
       " ' Vascular calcification is a potent predictor of plaque instability and cardiac events . Osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , well-known vascular calcification mediator , is a signaling molecule involved in bone remodeling , which has been implicated in the regulation of vascular calcification and atherogenesis . The purpose of this study was to compare the combination treatments of olmesartan/azelnidipine and olmesartan/diuretics on serum bone-related markers in patients with essential hypertension . A total of 48 patients with hypertension treated with 20 mg olmesartan were randomized to receive combination treatment with 16 mg azelnidipine ( O/A group ) or diuretics ( 1 mg indapamide ; O/D group ) for 12 months . Osteoprotegerin , matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2 ) , and high-sensitive CRP ( hs-CRP ) were measured after 3 and 12 months of treatment . Cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) was measured as the arterial stiffness using a VaSera CAVI instrument at the same time points . In both groups , the systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction is similar . Serum OPG , MMP-2 , and hs-CRP were significantly decreased at 12 months in the O/A group ( P < .05 ) , while there were no significant reductions in the O/D group . CAVI was significantly improved at 12 months in both the treatment groups . The improvement in CAVI was significantly greater in the O/A group than in the O/D group . Azelnidipine , but not indapamide , combined with olmesartan , improved arterial stiffness and were associated with significant decrease in OPG , MMP-2 , and hs-CRP concentrations . These results suggest that the beneficial effects of the combination treatments of olmesartan/azelnidipine on arterial stiffness are mediated by alteration in bone-remodeling and inflammatory markers .',\n",
       " \" Excessive alcohol use is a prevalent and worldwide problem . Excessive drinking causes a significant burden of disease and is associated with both morbidity and excess mortality . Prototype alteration and provision of a cue reminder could be useful strategies to enhance the effectiveness of online tailored interventions for excessive drinking . Through a Web-based randomized controlled trial , 2 strategies ( ie , prototype alteration and cue reminders ) within an existing online personalized feedback intervention ( Drinktest ) aimed to reduce adults ' excessive drinking . It was expected that both strategies would add to Drinktest and would result in reductions in alcohol consumption by intrinsic motivation and the seizure of opportunities to act . Participants were recruited online and through printed materials . Excessive drinking adults ( N = 2634 ) were randomly assigned to 4 conditions : original Drinktest , Drinktest plus prototype alteration , Drinktest plus cue reminder , and Drinktest plus prototype alteration and cue reminder . Evaluation took place at 1-month posttest and 6-month follow-up . Differences in drinking behavior , intentions , and behavioral willingness ( ie , primary outcomes ) were assessed by means of longitudinal multilevel analyses using a last observation carried forward method . Measures were based on self-reports . All conditions showed reductions in drinking behavior and willingness to drink , and increased intentions to reduce drinking . Prototype alteration ( B = -0.15 , P < .05 ) and cue reminder usage ( B = -0.15 , P < .05 ) were both more effective in reducing alcohol consumption than when these strategies were not provided . Combining the strategies did not produce a synergistic effect . No differences across conditions were found regarding intentions or willingness . Although individuals ' awareness of their cue was reasonable , their reported alcohol consumption was nevertheless reduced . Individuals appeared to distance their self-image from heavier drinking prototypes . Thus , prototype alteration and cue reminder usage may be feasible and simple intervention strategies to promote reductions in alcohol consumption among adults , with an effect up to 6 months .

To determine whether eliglustat , a novel oral substrate reduction therapy , safely reverses clinical manifestations in untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1 . Phase 3 , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in 12 countries from November 2009 to July 2012 among eligible patients with splenomegaly plus thrombocytopenia and/or anemia . Of 72 patients screened , 40 were enrolled . Patients were stratified by spleen volume and randomized 1:1 to receive eliglustat ( 50 or 100 mg twice daily ; n = 20 ) or placebo ( n = 20 ) for 9 months . The primary efficacy end point was percentage change in spleen volume in multiples of normal from baseline to 9 months ; secondary efficacy end points were change in hemoglobin level and percentage changes in liver volume and platelet count . All patients had baseline splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia ( mostly moderate or severe ) , most had mild or moderate hepatomegaly , and 20 % had mild anemia . Least-square mean spleen volume decreased by 27.77 % ( 95 % CI , -32.57 % to -22.97 % ) in the eliglustat group ( from 13.89 to 10.17 multiples of normal ) vs an increase of 2.26 % ( 95 % CI , -2.54 % to 7.06 % ) in the placebo group ( from 12.50 to 12.84 multiples of normal ) for an absolute treatment difference of -30.03 % ( 95 % CI , -36.82 % to -23.24 % ; P < .001 ) . For the secondary end points , the least-square mean absolute differences between groups all favored eliglustat , with a 1.22-g / dL increase in hemoglobin level ( 95 % CI , 0.57-1 .88 g/dL ; P < .001 ) , 6.64 % decrease in liver volume ( 95 % CI , -11.37 % to -1.91 % ; P = .007 ) , and 41.06 % increase in platelet count ( 95 % CI , 23.95 % -58.17 % ; P < .001 ) . No serious adverse events occurred . One patient in the eliglustat group withdrew ( non-treatment related ) ; 39 of the 40 patients transitioned to an open-label extension study . Among previously untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1 , treatment with eliglustat compared with placebo for 9 months resulted in significant improvements in spleen volume , hemoglobin level , liver volume , and platelet count . The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain , and more definitive conclusions about clinical efficacy and utility will require comparison with the standard treatment of enzyme replacement therapy as well as longer-term follow-up . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00891202 .',\n",

       " ' Most primary care clinicians lack the skills and resources to offer effective lifestyle and medication ( L&M ) counseling to reduce coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk . Thus , effective and feasible CHD prevention programs are needed for typical practice settings . To assess the effectiveness , acceptability , and cost-effectiveness of a combined L&M intervention to reduce CHD risk offered in counselor-delivered and web-based formats . A comparative effectiveness trial in 5 diverse family medicine practices in North Carolina . Participants were established patients , aged 35 to 79 years , with no known cardiovascular disease , and at moderate to high risk for CHD ( 10-year Framingham Risk Score [ FRS ] , 10 % ) . Participants were randomized to counselor-delivered or web-based format , each including 4 intensive and 3 maintenance sessions . After randomization , both formats used a web-based decision aid showing potential CHD risk reduction associated with L&M risk-reducing strategies . Participants chose the risk-reducing strategies they wished to follow . The primary outcome was within-group change in FRS at 4-month follow-up . Other measures included standardized assessments of blood pressure , blood lipid levels , lifestyle behaviors , and medication adherence . Acceptability and cost-effectiveness were also assessed . Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 12 months . Of 2274 screened patients , 385 were randomized ( 192 counselor ; 193 web ) : mean age , 62 years ; 24 % African American ; and mean FRS , 16.9 % . Follow-up at 4 and 12 months included 91 % and 87 % of the randomized participants , respectively .

       " ' This randomized , double-blind 8 week study compared the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose treatment with vortioxetine ( 10mg/day ) and venlafaxine extended release ( XR ) ( 150mg/day ) in major depressive disorder ( MDD ) patients . Patients aged 18-65 years with a primary diagnosis of recurrent MDD , a Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score 26 and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity ( CGI-S ) score 4 were randomized ( 1:1 ) to treatment with either vortioxetine or venlafaxine XR . The primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS total score ( analysis of covariance [ ANCOVA ] , full-analysis set [ FAS ] , last observation carried forward [ LOCF ] ) , using a non-inferiority margin of +2.5 points . Pre-specified secondary endpoints included MADRS response and remission rates , anxiety symptoms ( HAM-A ) , CGI , overall functioning ( SDS ) , and health-related quality of life ( Q-LES-Q ) . This study ( SOLUTION ) has the www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT01571453 . On the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 8 , non-inferiority was established with a difference of -1.2 MADRS points in favor of vortioxetine ( 95 % CI : -3.0 to 0.6 ) . The MADRS total score decreased ( improved ) from 32.34.6 at baseline to 13.69.6 ( vortioxetine : n = 209 ) and from 32.34.5 to 14.810.4 ( venlafaxine XR : n = 215 ) ( FAS , LOCF ) . At Week 8 , the HAM-A and SDS total scores , CGI and Q-LES-Q scores , and response and remission rates demonstrated similar improvement for vortioxetine and venlafaxine XR , with remission rates ( MADRS 10 ) of 43.1 % ( vortioxetine ) versus 41.4 % ( venlafaxine XR ) ( LOCF ) . Fewer vortioxetine than venlafaxine XR patients withdrew for any reason ( 18.0 % versus 27.4 % ) or for adverse events ( 6.6 % versus 13.7 % ) . The most frequent adverse events ( 5 % ) for both treatments were nausea , dizziness , headache , and dry mouth . In addition , accidental overdose , decreased appetite , constipation and insomnia were reported by ( 5 % ) of patients treated with venlafaxine XR . The inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of the study . Since patients with a history of lack of response to venlafaxine XR were excluded from this study , there is a selection bias in favor of venlafaxine XR . Vortioxetine was at least as efficacious as venlafaxine XR and was safe and better tolerated than venlafaxine XR .',\n",
       " ' Empiric antibiotic monotherapy is considered the standard of treatment for febrile neutropenic patients with cancer , but this approach may be inadequate because of the increasing prevalence of infections caused by multidrug resistant ( MDR ) bacteria . In this multicenter , open-label , randomized , superiority trial , adult , febrile , high-risk neutropenic patients ( FhrNPs ) with hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned to receive piperacillin/tazobactam ( 4.5 g intravenously every 8 hours ) with or without tigecycline ( 50 mg intravenously every 12 hours ; loading dose 100 mg ) . The primary end point was resolution of febrile episode without modifications of the initial allocated treatment . Three hundred ninety FhrNPs were enrolled ( combination/monotherapy , 187/203 ) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis ( ITTA ) . The ITTA revealed a successful outcome in 67.9 % v 44.3 % of patients who had received combination therapy and monotherapy , respectively ( 127/187 v 90/203 ; absolute difference in risk ( adr ) , 23.6 % ; 95 % CI , 14 % to 33 % ; P < .001 ) . The combination regimen proved better than monotherapy in bacteremias ( adr , 32.8 % ; 95 % CI , 19 % to 46 % ; P < .001 ) and in clinically documented infections ( adr , 36 % ; 95 % CI , 9 % to 64 % ; P < .01 ) . Mortality and number of adverse effects were limited and similar in the two groups . The combination of piperacillin/tazobactam and tigecycline is safe , well tolerated , and more effective than piperacillin/tazobactam alone in febrile , high-risk , neutropenic hematologic patients with cancer . In epidemiologic settings characterized by a high prevalence of infections because of MDR microorganisms , this combination could be considered as one of the first-line empiric antibiotic therapies .',\n",
       " ' To compare pregabalin versus placebo and pramipexole for reducing restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) - related sleep disturbance . Randomized , double-blinded , crossover trial . Twenty-three US sleep centers . Eighty-five individuals with moderate to severe idiopathic RLS and associated sleep disturbance . Participants were randomized across 6 treatment sequences comprising three 4-week periods on pregabalin 300 mg/day ( n = 75 ) , pramipexole 0.5 mg/day ( n = 76 ) , or placebo ( n = 73 ) . Polysomnography was conducted over 2 nights at the end of each period . Primary ( wake after sleep onset [ WASO ] , pregabalin vs placebo ) and key secondary endpoints were analyzed for statistical significance , with descriptive statistics for other endpoints . Pregabalin improved sleep maintenance , demonstrated by reductions in WASO ( -27.1 min vs placebo [ P < 0.0001 ] ; -26.9 vs pramipexole ) and number of awakenings after sleep onset ( -2.7 vs placebo ; -7.9 vs pramipexole [ P < 0.0001 ] ) by polysomnography , and an increase in subjective total sleep time ( 30.8 min vs placebo [ P < 0.0001 ] ; 26.8 vs pramipexole ) . Pregabalin also increased slow wave sleep duration ( 20.9 min vs placebo ; 32.1 vs pramipexole [ P < 0.0001 ] ) . Reduction in periodic limb movement arousal index ( PLMAI ) with pregabalin was similar to pramipexole and greater than placebo ( -3.7 PLMA/h [ P < 0.0001 ] ) , although reduction in total PLM in sleep was less than for pramipexole . This study demonstrated improvements in objective and subjective measures of sleep maintenance and sleep architecture with pregabalin compared with placebo and pramipexole . Effects of pregabalin on periodic limb movement arousal index were comparable to pramipexole . ClinicalTrials.gov identifier , NCT00991276 ; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00991276 .',\n",
       " ' Limited data exist on radial access in carotid artery stenting . This multicentre prospective randomised study was performed to compare the outcome and complication rates of transradial and transfemoral carotid artery stenting . The clinical and angiographic data of 260 consecutive patients with high risk for carotid endarterectomy , treated between 2010 and 2012 by carotid stenting with cerebral protection , were evaluated . Patients were randomised to transradial ( n = 130 ) or transfemoral ( n = 130 ) groups and several parameters were evaluated . Primary combined endpoint : major adverse cardiac and cerebral events , rate of access-site complications . Secondary endpoints : angiographic outcome of the procedure , fluoroscopy time and X-ray dose , procedural time , crossover rate to another puncture site and hospitalisation in days . Procedural success was achieved in all 260 patients ( 100 % ) , the crossover rate was 10 % in the TR and 1.5 % in the TF group ( p < 0.05 ) . A major access-site complication was encountered in one patient ( 0.9 % ) in the TR group and in one patient ( 0.8 % ) in the TF group ( p = ns ) . The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events was 0.9 % in the TR and 0.8 % in the TF group ( p = ns ) . Procedure time ( 1,620 [ 1,230-2 ,100 ] vs. 1,500 [ 1,080-2 ,100 ] sec , p = ns ) and fluoroscopy time ( 540 [ 411-735 ] vs. 501 [ 378-702 ] sec , p = ns ) were not significantly different , but the radiation dose was significantly higher in the TR group ( 195 [ 129-274 ] vs. 148 [ 102-237 ] Gy * cm2 , p < 0.05 ) by per-protocol analysis . Hospitalisation days were significantly lower in the TR group ( 1.170.40 vs. 1.250.45 , p < 0.05 ) . By intention-to-treat analysis there was a significantly higher radiation dose in the TR group ( 195 [ 130-288 ] vs. 150 [ 104-241 ] , p < 0.05 ) , but no difference in major events ( 0.9 vs. 0.8 , p = ns ) and length of hospitalisation in days ( 1.42.6 vs. 1.250.45 , p = ns ) . The transradial approach for carotid artery stenting is safe and efficacious ; however , the crossover rate is higher with transradial access . There are no differences in the total procedure duration and fluoroscopy time between the two approaches but the radiation dose is significantly higher in the radial group , and the hospitalisation is shorter with the use of transradial access by per-protocol analysis . By evaluating the patient data according to intention-to-treat analysis we found no difference in major adverse events and hospitalisation . In both groups , vascular complications rarely occurred .',\n",
       " ' Here , we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA vaccine , HB-110 , in mice and Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) undergoing adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) treatment . For animal study , mice ( BALB/c or HBV transgenic ) were immunized with mHB-110 , and T-cell and antibody responses were evaluated . For clinical study , 27 patients randomly received either ADV alone or ADV in combination with HB-110 . Liver function tests , serum HBV DNA levels and the presence of HBeAg/anti-HBe were analysed . T-cell responses were estimated by ELISPOT and FACS analysis . mHB-110 induced higher T-cell and antibody responses than mHB-100 in mice . No adverse effects were observed by HB-110 cotreated with ADV. HBV-specific T-cell responses were induced in a portion of patients in medium to high dose of HB-110 . Interestingly , HB-110 exhibited positive effects on ALT normalization and maintenance of HBeAg seroconversion . One patient , who received high dose of HB-110 exhibited HBeAg seroconversion during vaccination , which correlated with vaccine-induced T-cell responses without ALT elevation . HB-110 was safe and tolerable in CHB patients . In contrast to results in animal models , HB-110 in Korean patients exhibited weaker capability of inducing HBV-specific T-cell responses and HBeAg seroconversion than HB-100 in Caucasian patients . As Asian patients , who are generally infected via vertical transmission , appeared to have higher level of immune tolerance than Caucasian , novel approaches for breaking immune tolerance rather than enhancing immunogenicity may be more urgently demanded to develop effective therapeutic HBV DNA vaccines .',\n",
       " ' We assessed the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of ponesimod , an oral , selective , reversible modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 , in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis . Between Sept 22 , 2010 , and Oct 24 , 2012 , patients with psoriasis area and severity index ( PASI ) scores higher than 10 were enrolled into this multicentre double-blind , phase 2 study . They received 20 mg or 40 mg ponesimod or placebo once daily for 16 weeks . Those with at least 50 % reduction in PASI score at 16 weeks and who were receiving ponesimod were rerandomised to receive maintenance ponesimod therapy or placebo until week 28 . The primary endpoint was reduction in PASI score from baseline of at least 75 % ( PASI75 ) at week 16 . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01208090 . Of 326 patients initially randomised ( 20 mg ponesimod n = 126 , 40 mg ponesimod n = 133 , and placebo n = 67 ) PASI75 was achieved at week 16 in 58 ( 460 % ) , 64 ( 481 % ) , and nine ( 134 % ) , respectively . The treatment effect was significant for the two ponesimod doses ( both p < 00001 ) . Of 219 patients who entered the maintenance period , PASI75 was achieved by week 28 in 35 ( 714 % ) of 49 who continued on 20 mg ponesimod and 41 ( 774 % ) of 53 on 40 mg ponesimod , and in 19 ( 422 % ) of 45 who swapped from 20 mg to placebo and 19 ( 404 % ) of 47 from 40 mg to placebo .

       " ' We have previously reported excellent cecal intubation rates using a short double-balloon endoscope in patients with a history of incomplete colonoscopy . However , data on the endoscopic treatment of colorectal tumors using a double-balloon endoscope are limited . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic intervention of colorectal tumors using a short double-balloon endoscope . We analyzed data from a multicenter , prospective study on 110 patients ( 62 men , median age 66.5 years ) who underwent total colonoscopy after incomplete colonoscopy to assess the characteristics of colorectal tumors , endoscopic interventions , and complications . In all , 113 colorectal tumors were detected in 55 patients ; 109 of the tumors were adenomas ( 24 advanced adenomas ) and two each were intramucosal and advanced cancers . Locations of the lesions were eight in the cecum , 30 in the ascending colon , 18 in the transverse colon , 12 in the descending colon , 34 in the sigmoid colon , five in the rectosigmoid and six in the rectum . Average tumor diameter was 6.86.3 mm . Fifty-nine polypectomies , 22 endoscopic mucosal resections , four hot biopsies , and six cold biopsies were done . All endoscopic interventions were successfully completed and no complications were noted . Two advanced cancers were located in the ascending colon and only a double-balloon endoscope could reach them to take a biopsy sample . Double-balloon endoscopy is effective and safe for endoscopic intervention of colorectal tumors , irrespective of the location , in patients after incomplete colonoscopy .',\n",
       " ' The commonality between chronic conditions that are treated with low-dose ketamine , such as specific chronic pain conditions , depression , and post-traumatic stress disorder , can be found in relation to the stress system , particularly the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis . In this study we assess the effect of ketamine on the stress system by measuring plasma and saliva cortisol production during and following exposure to low-dose ketamine . In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled study , the influence of subanaesthetic ketamine ( 0.29 mg kg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) for 1 h , followed by 0.57 mg kg ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) for another hour ) was studied with repeated plasma and saliva cortisol samples in 12 healthy male volunteers . A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was used to describe the circadian rhythm-dependent ketamine-induced production of cortisol . The endogenous mean baseline cortisol production was 7.9 ( SE 1.5 ) nM min ( -1 ) . Consistent with the circadian rhythm , cortisol production decayed by 1.25 nM min ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) . Ketamine doubled the cortisol production at a concentration of 165 ( SE 35 ) ng ml ( -1 ) . The salivary cortisol concentration closely mirrored the plasma concentration and was exponentially related to the plasma concentration with , at 100 ng ml ( -1 ) ketamine , a saliva : plasma ratio of 0.036 ( se 0.006 ) . Ketamine has an appreciable effect on cortisol production . This may impact on critical physiological and psychological functions .

       " \" The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to compare knee stability , kneeling pain , harvest site pain , sensitivity loss , and subjective clinical outcome after primary anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction with either bone-patellar tendon-bone ( BPTB ) or quadriceps tendon-bone ( QTB ) autografts in a noninferiority study design . From 2005 to 2009 , a total of 51 patients were included in the present study . Inclusion criteria were isolated ACL injuries in adults . Twenty-five patients were randomized to BPTB grafts and 26 to QTB grafts . An independent examiner performed follow-up evaluations 1 and 2 years postoperatively . Anteroposterior knee laxity was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer ( MEDmetric , San Diego , CA ) . Anterior knee pain was assessed clinically and by knee-walking ability . Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) score were used for patient-evaluated outcome . Anterior knee laxity was equal between the 2 groups with KT-1000 values of 1.1 1.4 mm and 0.8 1.7 mm standard deviation ( SD ) at follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups , respectively ( P = .65 ) , whereas positive pivot shift test results were seen less frequently ( 14 % compared with 38 % , respectively ; P = .03 ) . Anterior kneeling pain , evaluated by the knee walking ability test , was significantly less in the QTB group , with only 7 % of patients grading knee walking as difficult or impossible compared with 34 % in the BPTB group . At 1 and 2 years ' follow-up , there was no difference between the 2 groups in subjective patient-evaluated outcome . The IKDC score was 75 13 patients and 76 16 SD at 1-year follow-up in QTB and BPTB groups , respectively ( P = .78 ) . At 2 years , 12 patients were lost to follow-up , resulting in 18 in the BPTB group and 21 in the QTB group . The use of the QTB graft results in less kneeling pain , graft site pain , and sensitivity loss than seen with BPTB grafts ; however , similar anterior knee stability and subjective outcomes are seen . The results of this study show that QTB is a viable option for ACL reconstruction . Level II , randomized controlled clinical trial .\",\n",

Fifty-one women on hemodialysis and 9 with chronic kidney disease stage 5 were randomly assigned to receive oral raloxifene , 60 mg/d , or placebo for 8 months . Baseline blood determinations and BMD were done and repeated after 8 months . Serum levels of total calcium , phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase , and intact PTH were measured . Serum levels of intact PTH significantly decreased in both groups , and there was no difference between the two groups after 8 months ( P = .37 ) . Serum phosphorus levels also decreased by 1.8 % in the two groups . After 8 months of treatment , the BMD of the lumbar spine and femural neck decreased by 1.9 % in the control group , while an increase in BMD was observed in the raloxifene group , with an average increase in both BMDs of the lumbar spine and the femural neck by 2 % ( significant in the lumbar spine ; P = .01 ) . Raloxifene has proven to be an effective medication in terms of improving BMD , with no adverse effects . However , it had no effect on controlling hyperparathyroidism in our patients .

The prospective , randomised , double-blinded study was conducted at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical School , Turkey , from October 2008 to December 2009 . It comprised 45 American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade I and II patients under elective surgery of the hand and forearm . The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups : 5 mg/kg of 2 % prilocaine was applied to Group 1 ; 5 mg/kg of 2 % prilocaine +8 mg of dexamethasone ( 2 ml ) was applied to Group 2 ; and 1.5 mg/kg 0.5 % levobupivacaine was applied to Group 3 . Sensory and motor block onset time as well as the duration of motor and sensory block of those were monitored and recorded . SPSS 15 was used for statistical analysis . Of the 45 patients , 27 ( 60 % ) were men and 18 ( 40 % ) were women . There was no significant difference among the groups in terms of demographic data . Based on the duration of motor and sensory block , similar periods of time in Group 1 and Group 2 were noted , whereas this period was statistically different and significantly longer in Group 3 ( p < or = 0.001 ) . There were no complications encountered . The addition of dexamethasone to prilocaine prolonged the duration of sensory and motor block . It could be used as an effective adjuvant agent . Levobupivacain could be a more appropriate local anaesthetic in postoperative analgesia and prolonged surgical procedures .',\n",

Twenty-five sedentary , obese ( BMI > 30 kg/m2 ) males ( 52.8 7.2 years ) ; 12 controls versus 13 T2DM were randomly allocated to four groups that exercised for 30 min , three times per week either at low ( Fat-Max ; 30-40 % VO ( 2max ) ) or moderate ( T ( vent ) ; 55-65 % VO ( 2max ) ) intensity . Before and after training , blood and muscle samples ( v. lateralis ) were collected . Baseline erythrocyte glutathione was lower ( 21.8 2.8 vs. 32.7 4.4 nmol/ml ) and plasma protein oxidative damage and IL-6 were higher in T2DM ( 141.7 52.1 vs. 75.5 41.6 nmol/ml ) . Plasma catalase increased in T2DM after T ( vent ) training ( from 0.98 0.22 to 1.96 0.3 nmol/min/ml ) . T2DM groups demonstrated evidence of oxidative damage in response to training ( elevated protein carbonyls ) . Baseline serum tNOx were higher in controls than T2DM ( 18.68 2.78 vs. 12.34 3.56 mol/l ) . Training at T ( vent ) increased muscle nNOS and tNOx in the control group only . Pre-training muscle nNOS was higher in controls than in T2DMs , while the opposite was found for iNOS . No differences were found after training for plasma inflammatory markers . Exercise training did not change body composition or aerobic fitness , but improved OS markers , especially when performed at T ( vent ) . Non-diabetics responded to T ( vent ) training by increasing muscle nNOS expression and tNOx levels in skeletal muscle while these parameters did not change in T2DM , perhaps due to higher insulin resistance ( unchanged after intervention ) .',\n",

       " ' Rapid HIV testing in high-risk populations can increase the number of persons who learn their HIV status and avoid spending clinic resources to locate persons identified as HIV infected . We determined the cost to sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) clinics of point-of-care rapid HIV testing using data from 7 public clinics that participated in a randomized trial of rapid testing with and without brief patient-centered risk reduction counseling in 2010 . Costs included counselor and trainer time , supplies , and clinic overhead . We applied national labor rates and test costs . We calculated median clinic start-up costs and mean cost per patient tested , and projected incremental annual costs of implementing universal rapid HIV testing compared with current testing practices . Criteria for offering rapid HIV testing and methods for delivering nonrapid test results varied among clinics before the trial . Rapid HIV testing cost an average of US $ 22/patient without brief risk reduction counseling and US $ 46/patient with counseling in these 7 clinics . Median start-up costs per clinic were US $ 1100 and US $ 16,100 without and with counseling , respectively . Estimated incremental annual costs per clinic of implementing universal rapid HIV testing varied by whether or not brief counseling is conducted and by current clinic testing practices , ranging from a savings of US $ 19,500 to a cost of US $ 40,700 without counseling and a cost of US $ 98,000 to US $ 153,900 with counseling . Universal rapid HIV testing in STD clinics with same-day results can be implemented at relatively low cost to STD clinics , if brief risk reduction counseling is not offered .',\n",
       " ' The risk of persistent tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) was compared in patients with acute psychosis or agitation aged 55 years or older who were treated with olanzapine ( OLZ ) or conventional antipsychotic ( CNV ) drug therapy . Patients without TD were randomized to treatment with OLZ ( 2.5-20 mg/d ; n = 150 ) or CNV ( dosed per label ; n = 143 ) . Following a 6-week drug tapering/initiation period , patients without TD were treated with OLZ or CNV for up to 1 year . The a priori defined primary outcome end point was persistent TD defined as Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) scores = 2 on at least 2 items or 3 on at least 1 item ( items 1-7 ) lasting at least for 1 month ( Criterion A ) . Post hoc analyses assessed persistent TD meeting the criterion of moderate severity defined as AIMS score 3 on at least 1 item persisting for 1 month ( Criterion B ) and probable TD defined as elevated AIMS scores ( Criterion A or B ) not persisting for 1 month . Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank exact test . On average , patients were 78 years of age ; the predominant diagnosis was dementia ( 76.7 % in the OLZ group and 82.5 % in the CNV group ) . Approximately , 40.6 % of patients in the CNV group received haloperidol . No significant difference in time to developing persistent TD was observed during treatment with OLZ or CNV ( cumulative incidence : OLZ , 2.5 % [ 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] : 0.5-7 .0 ] ; CNV , 5.5 % [ 95 % CI : 2.1-11 .6 ] , P = .193 ) .

       " ' Characteristics and outcomes of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction receiving care at Veterans Affairs ( VA ) versus non-VA hospitals have not been previously reported . In the randomized controlled Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial ( BEST ; 1995-1999 ) , of the 2707 ( bucindolol = 1353 ; placebo = 1354 ) patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction 35 % , 918 received care at VA hospitals , of which 98 % ( n = 898 ) were male . Of the 1789 receiving care at non-VA hospitals , 68 % ( n = 1216 ) were male . Our analyses were restricted to these 2114 male patients . VA patients were older with higher symptom and comorbidity burdens . There was no significant between-group difference in unadjusted primary end point of 2-year all-cause mortality ( 35 % VA versus 32 % non-VA ; hazard ratio associated with VA hospitals , 1.09 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.94-1 .26 ) , which remained unchanged after adjustment for age and race ( hazard ratio , 1.00 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.86-1 .16 ) or multivariable adjustment , including cardiovascular morbidities ( hazard ratio , 0.94 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.80-1 .10 ) . There was no between-group difference in cause-specific mortalities or hospitalizations . Chronic kidney disease , pulmonary edema , left ventricular ejection fraction < 20 % , and peripheral arterial disease were significant predictors of mortality for both groups . African America race , New York Heart Association class IV symptoms , atrial fibrillation , and right ventricular ejection fraction < 20 % were associated with higher mortality among non-VA hospital patients only ; however , these differences from VA patients were not significant .

       " ' The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of different strategies of ivabradine therapy by comparing the effects on heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , and image quality of coronary CT angiography ( CTA ) . A total of 192 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups of oral premedication with ivabradine 15 mg ( single dose ) , 10 mg ( single dose ) , and 5 mg twice daily for 5 days , prospectively . Patients using HR-lowering drugs and patients with - blockade contraindication were excluded . The target HR was 65 beats/min . In addition 5 to 10 mg of intravenous metoprolol was administered to the patients at the CT unit , if required . The systolic and diastolic blood BP values and the HRs were recorded . Image quality was assessed for 8 of 15 coronary segments with a 4-point grading scale . Results were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test , one-way ANOVA , and 2 test . Reductions in mean HR after the treatment were 18 6 , 14 4 , and 17 7 beats/min for groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . With the total additional therapies , 81.3 % , 67.2 % , and 84.3 % of the patients achieved HR < 65 beats/min in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . The mean BP values before coronary CTA were not significantly changed except for patients in group 2 . Unacceptable ( score 0 ) image quality was obtained in only 4.5 % , 10.2 % , and 4.2 % of all the coronary segments , in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . Our study indicates that coronary CTA with premedication with oral ivabradine in all 3 strategies is safe and effective in reducing HR , in particular with a - blockade combination . All 3 ivabradine regimes may be an alternative strategy for HR lowering in patients undergoing coronary CTA . Ivabradine 15 mg ( single dose ) and ivabradine 5 mg twice daily for 5 days are superior to the ivabradine 10-mg single-dose regime for HR lowering without adjunctive intravenous - blocker usage .',\n",
       " ' There has been no systematic investigation of the individual and combined effects of impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) and obesity on cognitive function in the absence of ageing . The aims were to examine the effects of IGT and increased waist circumference on cognitive function in ostensibly healthy adults , and to investigate whether a low glycaemic load ( GL ) breakfast can attenuate cognitive impairments in these populations . Sixty five females aged 30-50 years were classified into one of four groups following waist circumference ( WC ) measurements and an oral glucose tolerance test : NGT/low WC ( n = 25 ) , NGT/high WC ( n = 22 ) , IGT/low WC ( n = 9 ) , IGT/high WC ( n = 9 ) . Memory , psychomotor and executive functions were examined 30 and 120 min after consuming low GL , high GL and water breakfasts according to a randomised , crossover , counterbalanced design . IGT was associated with impairment of verbal and spatial memory , and psychomotor function relative to females with NGT , independent of waist circumference . Increased waist circumference was associated with impairment of verbal memory and executive function relative to females with low WC , independent of IGT . Consumption of the LGL breakfast attenuated verbal memory impairment in the IGT/high WC group relative to the HGL breakfast and no energy control . Increased central adiposity and abnormalities in glucose tolerance preceding type 2 diabetes can have demonstrable negative effects on cognitive function , even in ostensibly healthy , middle-aged females . The potential for GL manipulations to modulate glycaemic response and cognitive function in type 2 diabetes and obesity merits further investigation .',\n",
       " ' Tracheal intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope is taught to medical students as it is a lifesaving procedure . However , it is a difficult technique to learn and the consequences of intubation failure are potentially serious . The Airtraq optical laryngoscope is a relatively novel intubation device , which allows visualization of the glottic plane without alignment of the oral , pharyngeal , and tracheal axes , possessing advantages over Macintosh for novice personnel . We introduced a teaching mode featured with a progressive evaluation scheme for preparation and performance of tracheal intubation with medical students in this prospective randomized crossover trial who had no prior airway management experience to find the superior one . Twenty-six medical students of the 8-year programme in the 6th year participated in this trial , when they did their one-week rotation in the department of anaesthesiology . Each of the students intubated 6 patients , who were scheduled for surgeries under general anaesthesia , each laryngoscope for 3 patients respectively . One hundred and forty-nine consecutive patients scheduled for surgical procedures requiring tracheal intubation were enrolled . Patients were randomly allocated to undergo tracheal intubation using Macintosh ( n = 75 ) or Airtraq ( n = 74 ) laryngoscope . The progressive evaluation scheme was applied to each intubation attempt . Intubation success rate was significantly higher in Airtraq group than Macintosh group ( 87.8 % vs. 66.7 % , P < 0.05 ) . Duration of glottis exposure was significantly shorter in Airtraq group compared to Macintosh group ( 50 19 s vs. 81 27 s , P < 0.001 ) . A grade I Cormack and Lehane glottic view was obtained in 94.6 % of patients in the Airtraq group versus 32 % of patients in the Macintosh group ( P < 0.001 ) . Duration of intubation in Airtraq group was significantly shorter ( 68 21 s vs. 96 22 s , P < 0.05 ) compared to Macintosh group . Airtraq laryngoscope is easier to master for novice personnel with a higher intubation success rate and shorter intubation duration compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope .

       " ' Previously considered as a disease of the affluent , west or urban people and not of public health importance , diabetes mellitus is increasingly becoming a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa . However , population-based data to inform prevention , treatment and control are lacking . Using the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance , a population-based , nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and September 2009 on participants aged 25-64 years . A multi-stage cluster sample design and weighting were used to produce a national representative data for that age range . Detailed findings on the magnitude of diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting blood glucose are presented in this paper . Fasting blood glucose measurement was conducted on 3056 participants ( 70.2 % females , 87.9 % from rural areas ) . The age - sex standardised population-based mean fasting blood glucose was 4.3 mmol/L ( 95 % CI 4.1-4 .4 mmol/L ) with no significant differences by age , sex and location ( urban/rural ) . The overall prevalence of impaired fasting blood glucose was 4.2 % ( 95 % CI 3.0 % -5.4 % ) . Prevalence of impaired blood glucose was higher in men than in women , 5.7 % ( 95 % CI 3.9 % -7.5 % ) vs 2.7 % ( 95 % CI 1.6 % - 3.8 % ) , p < 0.01 . In both men and women , prevalence of raised fasting blood glucose or currently on medication for diabetes was 5.6 % ( 95 % CI 2.6 % - 8.5 % ) . Although the prevalence of diabetes was higher in men than women , 6.5 % ( 95 % CI 2.6 % -10.3 % ) vs 4.7 % ( 95 % CI 2.4 % -7.0 % ) , in rural than urban , 5.4 % ( 95 % CI 2.4 % -8.4 % ) vs 4.4 % ( 95 % CI 2.8 % -5.9 % ) and in males in rural than males in urban , 6.9 % ( 95 % CI 2.8 % -11.0 % ) vs 3.2 % ( 95 % CI 0.1 % -6.3 % ) , the differences were not statistically significant , p > 0.05 . Compared to previous estimates , prevalence of diabetes increased from < 1.0 % in 1960s to 5.6 % in 2009 ( this study ) . High prevalence of impaired fasting blood glucose and diabetes mellitus call for the implementation of primary healthcare approaches such as the WHO package for essential non-communicable diseases to promote healthy lifestyles , early detection , treatment and control .',\n",
       " \" Malaria rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) are a valid alternative to malaria testing with microscopy and are recommended for the testing of febrile patients before prescribing an antimalarial . There is a need for interventions to support the uptake of RDTs by health workers . To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing RDTs with basic or enhanced training in health facilities in which microscopy was available , compared with current practice . A three-arm cluster randomized trial was conducted in 46 facilities in central and northwest Cameroon . Basic training had a practical session on RDTs and lectures on malaria treatment guidelines . Enhanced training included small-group activities designed to change health workers ' practice and reduce the consumption of antimalarials among test-negative patients . The primary outcome was the proportion of febrile patients correctly treated : febrile patients should be tested for malaria , artemisinin combination therapy should be prescribed for confirmed cases , and no antimalarial should be prescribed for patients who are test-negative . Individual patient data were obtained from facility records and an exit survey . Costs were estimated from a societal perspective using project reports and patient exit data . The analysis used bivariate multilevel modeling and adjusted for imbalance in baseline covariates . Incremental cost per febrile patient correctly treated was $ 8.40 for the basic arm and $ 3.71 for the enhanced arm . On scale-up , it was estimated that RDTs with enhanced training would save $ 0.75 per additional febrile patient correctly treated . Introducing RDTs with enhanced training was more cost-effective than RDTs with basic training when each was compared with current practice .\",\n",
       " ' Functional decline and frailty are common in community dwelling older adults , increasing the risk of adverse outcomes . Given this , we investigated the prevalence of frailty-associated risk factors and their distribution according to the severity of perceived risk in a cohort of community dwelling older adults , using the Risk Instrument for Screening in the Community ( RISC ) . A cohort of 803 community dwelling older adults were scored for frailty by their public health nurse ( PHN ) using the Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) and for risk of three adverse outcomes : i ) institutionalisation , ii ) hospitalisation and iii ) death , within the next year , from one ( lowest ) to five ( highest ) using the RISC . Prior to scoring , PHNs stated whether they regarded patients as frail . The median age of patients was 80years ( interquartile range 10 ) , of whom 64 % were female and 47.4 % were living alone . The median Abbreviated Mental Test Score ( AMTS ) was 10 ( 0 ) and Barthel Index was 18/20 ( 6 ) . PHNs regarded 42 % of patients as frail , while the CFS categorized 54 % ( scoring 5 ) as frail . Dividing patients into low-risk ( score one or two ) , medium-risk ( score three ) and high-risk ( score four or five ) using the RISC showed that 4.3 % were considered high risk of institutionalization , 14.5 % for hospitalization , and 2.7 % for death , within one year of the assessment . There were significant differences in median CFS ( 4/9 versus 6/9 versus 6/9 , p < 0.001 ) , Barthel Index ( 18/20 versus 11/20 versus 14/20 , p < 0.001 ) and mean AMTS scores ( 9.51 versus 7.57 versus 7.00 , p < 0.001 ) between those considered low , medium and high risk of institutionalisation respectively . Differences were also statistically significant for hospitalisation and death . Age , gender and living alone were inconsistently associated with perceived risk . Frailty most closely correlated with functional impairment , r = -0.80 , p < 0.001 . The majority of patients in this community sample were perceived to be low risk for adverse outcomes . Frailty , cognitive impairment and functional status were markers of perceived risk . Age , gender and social isolation were not and may not be useful indicators when triaging community dwellers . The RISC now requires validation against adverse outcomes .',\n",
       " ' Currently , there is limited data on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) in Indian patients . This post hoc study assessed the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant compared with aprepitant for prevention of CINV in the Indian population . A subgroup analysis was performed from data collected in a phase 3 study of intravenous ( IV ) fosaprepitant or oral aprepitant , plus the 5-HT 3 antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone , in cisplatin-nave patients with solid malignancies . Patients scheduled to receive cisplatin ( 70 mg/m 2 ) were administered a single IV dose of fosaprepitant dimeglumine ( 150 mg ) on day 1 or a 3-day dosing regimen of oral aprepitant ( day 1:125 mg , days 2 and 3:80 mg ) with standard doses of ondansetron and dexamethasone . Patients recorded nausea and/or vomiting episodes and their use of rescue medication and were monitored for adverse events ( AEs ) and tolerability . Differences in response rates between fosaprepitant and aprepitant were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method . In the Indian subpopulation ( n = 372 ) , efficacy was similar for patients in both the fosaprepitant or aprepitant groups ; complete response in the overall , acute , and delayed phases and no vomiting in all phases were approximately 4 percentage points higher in the fosaprepitant group compared with the aprepitant group . Fosaprepitant was generally well-tolerated ; common AEs were similar to oral aprepitant . IV fosaprepitant is as safe and effective as oral aprepitant in the Indian subpopulation and offers an alternative to the oral formulation .',\n",

In a cluster randomised controlled trial , the effectiveness of CSC compared to care as usual ( CAU ) for adults with panic disorder ( PD ) or generalised anxiety disorder ( GAD ) in primary care was evaluated . Thirty-one psychiatric nurses who provided their services to 43 primary care practices in the Netherlands were randomised to deliver CSC ( 16 psychiatric nurses , 23 practices ) or CAU ( 15 psychiatric nurses , 20 practices ) . CSC was provided by the psychiatric nurses ( care managers ) in collaboration with the general practitioner and a consultant psychiatrist . The intervention consisted of 3 steps , namely guided self-help , cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants . Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) at baseline and after 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months . We recruited 180 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PD or GAD , of whom 114 received CSC and 66 received usual primary care . On the BAI , CSC was superior to CAU [ difference in gain scores from baseline to 3 months : -5.11 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -8.28 to -1.94 ; 6 months : -4.65 , 95 % CI -7.93 to -1.38 ; 9 months : -5.67 , 95 % CI -8.97 to -2.36 ; 12 months : -6.84 , 95 % CI -10.13 to -3.55 ] .

To examine the value of measures of impairment , disability , and quality of life in assessing progression in early PD . Inception cohort analysis of data from 413 patients with early , untreated PD who were enrolled in 2 multicenter , randomized , double-blind clinical trials . Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatments ( 67 received creatine , 66 received minocycline , 71 received coenzyme Q10 , 71 received GPI-1485 , and 138 received placebo ) . We assessed the association between the rates of change in measures of impairment , disability , and quality of life and time to initiation of symptomatic treatment . Time between baseline assessment and need for the initiation of symptomatic pharmaceutical treatment for PD was the primary indicator of disease progression . After adjusting for baseline confounding variables with regard to the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Part II score , the UPDRS Part III score , the modified Rankin Scale score , level of education , and treatment group , we assessed the rate of change for the following measurements : the UPDRS Part II score ; the UPDRS Part III score ; the Schwab and England Independence Scale score ( which measures activities of daily living ) ; the Total Functional Capacity scale ; the 39-item Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire , summary index , and activities of daily living subscale ; and version 2 of the 12-item Short Form Health Survey Physical Summary and Mental Summary . Variables reaching the statistical threshold in univariate analysis were entered into a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model using time to symptomatic treatment as the dependent variable . More rapid change ( ie , worsening ) in the UPDRS Part II score ( hazard ratio , 1.15 [ 95 % CI , 1.08-1 .22 ] for 1 scale unit change per 6 months ) , the UPDRS Part III score ( hazard ratio , 1.09 [ 95 % CI , 1.06-1 .13 ] for 1 scale unit change per 6 months ) , and the Schwab and England Independence Scale score ( hazard ratio , 1.29 [ 95 % CI , 1.12-1 .48 ] for 5 percentage point change per 6 months ) was associated with earlier need for symptomatic therapy . AND RELEVANCE In early PD , the UPDRS Part II score and Part III score and the Schwab and England Independence Scale score can be used to measure disease progression , whereas the 39-item Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire and summary index , Total Functional Capacity scale , and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey Physical Summary and Mental Summary are not sensitive to change . clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers : NCT00063193 and NCT00076492 .\",\n",
       " ' To examine the effects of complex cognitive ( mahjong ) and physical ( Tai Chi ) activities on dementia severity in nursing home residents with dementia . Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design . 110 residents were randomized by nursing home into three conditions : mahjong , Tai Chi , and simple handicrafts ( control ) . Activities were conducted three times a week for 12 weeks . Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) was taken at 0 ( baseline ) , 3 ( post-treatment ) , 6 , and 9 months . The outcome measure was CDR sum-of-box , which is a composite measure of both cognitive and functional deterioration in dementia . Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using multilevel regression models . Apolipoprotein E 4 allele and education were included as covariates . Neither treatments had effects on the cognitive and functional components of the CDR , but mahjong had a significant interaction with time on the CDR sum-of-box total , suggesting a slower rate of global deterioration in the mahjong group as compared with the control group . Mahjong led to a gradual improvement in global functioning and a slightly slower rate of dementia progression over time . The effect was generalized and was not specific to cognition or daily functioning .',\n",

Stem cells have been a focus of intense preclinical research into tissue regeneration but limited clinical investigation . In a randomized , double-blind , controlled study , the safety of the intra-articular injection of human mesenchymal stem cells into the knee , the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to promote meniscus regeneration following partial meniscectomy , and the effects of mesenchymal stem cells on osteoarthritic changes in the knee were investigated . A total of fifty-five patients at seven institutions underwent a partial medial meniscectomy . A single superolateral knee injection was given within seven to ten days after the meniscectomy . Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups : Group A , in which patients received an injection of 50 10 allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells ; Group B , 150 10 allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells ; and the control group , a sodium hyaluronate ( hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan ) vehicle control . Patients were followed to evaluate safety , meniscus regeneration , the overall condition of the knee joint , and clinical outcomes at intervals through two years . Evaluations included sequential magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . No ectopic tissue formation or clinically important safety issues were identified . There was significantly increased meniscal volume ( defined a priori as a 15 % threshold ) determined by quantitative MRI in 24 % of patients in Group A and 6 % in Group B at twelve months post meniscectomy ( p = 0.022 ) . No patients in the control group met the 15 % threshold for increased meniscal volume . Patients with osteoarthritic changes who received mesenchymal stem cells experienced a significant reduction in pain compared with those who received the control , on the basis of visual analog scale assessments . There was evidence of meniscus regeneration and improvement in knee pain following treatment with allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells .

This study analyzes electromyography ( EMG ) of the diaphragm ( dEMG ) using implanted diaphragm pacing ( DP ) electrodes . Retrospective analysis of dEMG data were obtained during Institutional Review Board and US Food and Drug Administration approved trials . The electrodes were used to analyze epochs of dEMG during multiple respiratory cycles . Fifty-three patients were implanted . Thirty-six had bilateral dEMG assessments , 18 had continuous overnight readings with pulse oximetry , and 19 had serial analysis . Several findings revealed an alteration in the central respiratory drive including central apnea , hypoventilation , and hypercarbia . The electrodes showed unilateral dysfunction and demonstrated noninvasive ventilation suppression of diaphragm activity . DP can be used for serial monitoring , to decrease hypercarbia , improve sleep , and decrease atrophy . Multiple abnormalities of respiratory control can be seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients using dEMG through therapeutic DP electrodes . DP is used to overcome instability of respiratory control when there are intact diaphragm motor units leading to improved survival .',\n",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a year-long consumption of Pomegranate juice ( PJ ) , on two traditional cardiovascular ( CV ) risk factors : hypertension and lipid profile , as well as on cardiovascular events . 101 HD patients were randomized to receive 100cc of PJ ( 0.7 mM polyphenols ) or matching placebo juice , three times a week for one year . The primary endpoints were traditional CV risk factors ; blood pressure and lipid profile . Systolic , diastolic and pulse pressure , plasma levels of triglycerides ( TG ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and total cholesterol were monitored quarterly during the study year . Secondary endpoint was incidence of cardiovascular events . PJ consumption yielded a significant time response improvement in systolic blood pressure , pulse pressure , triglycerides and HDL level ; an improvement that was not observed in the placebo intake group . These beneficial outcomes were more pronounced among patients with hypertension , high level of triglycerides and low levels of HDL . Regular PJ consumption by HD patients reduced systolic blood pressure and improved lipid profile .

At the end of 90 days , the coronary flow reserve was improved in the three groups ( fluvastatin-treated group : 23.2 % ; diltiazem-treated group : 12.4 % ; fluvastatin + diltiazem-treated group : 29.1 % , all P < 0.05 ) . The time to 1 mm ST segment depression increased significantly in the fluvastatin-treated group ( from 24197 to 410140 s , P < 0.05 ) , the diltiazem-treated group ( from 25891 to 392124 s , P < 0.05 ) , and the fluvastatin + diltiazem-treated group ( from 250104 to 446164 s , P < 0.05 ) . The improvement in coronary flow reserve and prolonged time to 1 mm ST segment depression in the combination treatment group were more remarkable than in those who received monotherapy . Combination therapy also induced a significant increase ( 35.6 % , P < 0.05 ) in nitric oxide and an apparent reduction ( 48.7 % , P < 0.05 ) in endothelin-1 . Combination treatment with fluvastatin and diltiazem is more effective on endothelial function and exercise tolerance than solo treatment in patients with cardiac syndrome X. The benefits of these drugs may be related to the elevation of nitric oxide and reduction of endothelin-1 .',\n",

Computed-tomographic pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) is an accurate and safe test for diagnosing PE . The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the effects on image quality ( IQ ) of electrocardiogram ( ECG ) gating during CTPA . Fifty consecutive patients presenting for CTPA were included in the study . A single acquisition was performed , resulting in two reconstructions : one at 75 % of the R-R interval and the other without ECG influence . IQ evaluation was undertaken by two radiologists , focusing on respiratory and cardiac motion , image noise , low-contrast resolution , vessel and lung clarity , contrast media opacification and artefacts . Various regions of the lungs and vasculature were evaluated , and IQ scores were statistically compared . For the ECG-tagged reconstructions , IQ was noted to be better overall with regard to vessel clarity ( P < 0.05 ) and cardiac motion ( P < 0.05 ) , while lung clarity was better only in the left lower zone ( P < 0.05 ) . IQ was better with regard to image noise ( P < 0.05 ) and low-contrast resolution ( P < 0.05 ) in the non-ECG-tagged reconstructions . No statistical IQ difference between the two types of reconstruction was noted with regard to respiratory motion , contrast media opacification or presence of artefacts .

Pretreatment plasma samples were available from 510 patients . Plasma YKL-40 was determined by ELISA and dichotomized according to the age-corrected 95 % YKL-40 level in 3130 healthy subjects . Pretreatment plasma YKL-40 was elevated in 204 patients ( 40 % ) , and median YKL-40 was higher in patients with mCRC than in healthy subjects ( age adjusted , P < 0.001 ) . Patients with elevated YKL-40 had shorter PFS than patients with normal YKL-40 ( 7.5 vs. 8.2 months ; hazard ratio ( HR ) = 1.27 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.05-1 .53 P = 0.013 ) and shorter OS ( 16.8 vs. 23.9 months ; HR = 1.33 , 1.04-1 .69 , P = 0.024 ) . Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that elevated pretreatment YKL-40 was an independent biomarker of short OS ( HR = 1.12 , 1.01-1 .25 , P = 0.033 ) . The ratio of the updated plasma YKL-40 ( i.e. level after 1 , 2 , 8 weeks of treatment , and at end of treatment compared to the baseline level ) was associated with OS ( HR = 1.27 , 1.06-1 .52 , P = 0.011 ) . Plasma YKL-40 is an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with mCRC treated with first-line oxaliplatin-based therapy alone or combined with cetuximab .',\n",
       " ' Intra-myocardial transplantation of CD133 ( + ) bone marrow stem cells ( BMC ) yielded promising results in clinical pilot trials . We now performed the double-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled CARDIO133 trial to determine its impact on left ventricular ( LV ) function and clinical symptoms . Sixty patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease and impaired LV function ( left ventricular ejection fraction , LVEF < 35 % ) were randomized to undergo either coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) and injection of CD133 ( + ) BMC in the non-transmural , hypokinetic infarct border zone ( CD133 ) , or CABG and placebo injection ( placebo ) . Pre-operative LVEF was 27 6 % in CD133 patients and 26 6 % in placebo patients . Outcome was assessed after 6 months , and the primary endpoint was LVEF measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) at rest . The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups . There was no difference in 6-min walking distance , Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score , or Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) class between groups at follow-up , and New York Heart Association class improved more in the placebo group ( P = 0.004 ) . By cardiac MRI , LVEF at 6 months was 33 8 % in the placebo group and 31 7 % in verum patients ( P = 0.3 ) , with an average inter-group difference of -2.1 % ( 95 % CI -6.3 to 2.1 ) . Systolic or diastolic LV dimensions at 6 months were not different , either . In the CD133 group , myocardial perfusion at rest recovered in more LV segments than in the placebo group ( 9 vs. 2 % , P < 0.001 ) . Scar mass decreased by 2.2 5 g in CD133 ( + ) patients ( P = 0.05 ) , but was unchanged in the placebo group ( 0.3 4 g , P = 0.7 ; inter-group difference in change = 2 g ( 95 % CI -1.1 to 5 ) ) . By speckle-tracking echocardiography , cell-treated patients showed a better recovery of regional wall motion when the target area was posterior . Although there may be some improvements in scar size and regional perfusion , intra-myocardial injection of CD133 ( + ) BMC has no effect on global LV function and clinical symptoms . Improvements in regional myocardial function are only detectable in patients with posterior infarction , probably because the interventricular septum after anterior infarction is not accessible by trans-epicardial injection .

       " ' Although adolescent girls are the main population for prophylactic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccines , adult women who remain at risk of cervical cancer can also be vaccinated . We report data from the interim analysis of the ongoing VIVIANE study , the aim of which is to assess the efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in adult women . In this phase 3 , multinational , double-blind , randomised controlled trial , we randomly assigned healthy women older than 25 years to the HPV 16/18 vaccine or control ( 1:1 ) , via an internet-based system with an algorithm process that accounted for region , age stratum , baseline HPV DNA status , HPV 16/18 serostatus , and cytology . Enrolment was age-stratified , with about 45 % of participants in each of the 26-35 and 36-45 years age strata and 10 % in the 46 years and older stratum . Up to 15 % of women in each age stratum could have a history of HPV infection or disease . The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or higher ( CIN1 + ) associated with HPV 16/18 . The primary analysis was done in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy , which consists of women who received all three vaccine or control doses , had negative or low-grade cytology at baseline , and had no history of HPV disease . Secondary analyses included vaccine efficacy against non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types . Mean follow-up time was 403 months . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00294047 . The first participant was enrolled on Feb 16 , 2006 , and the last study visit for the present analysis took place on Dec 10 , 2010 ; 5752 women were included in the total vaccinated cohort ( n = 2881 vaccine , n = 2871 control ) , and 4505 in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy ( n = 2264 vaccine , n = 2241 control ) . Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related 6-month persistent infection or CIN1 + was significant in all age groups combined ( 811 % , 977 % CI 521-940 ) , in the 26-35 years age group ( 835 % , 450-968 ) , and in the 36-45 years age group ( 772 % , 28-969 ) ; no cases were seen in women aged 46 years and older . Vaccine efficacy against atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater associated with HPV 16/18 was also significant . We also noted significant cross-protective vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection with HPV 31 ( 791 % , 977 % CI 276-959 ) and HPV 45 ( 769 % , 185-956 ] ) Serious adverse events occurred in 285 ( 10 % ) of 2881 women in the vaccine group and 267 ( 9 % ) of 2871 in the control group ; five ( < 1 % ) and eight ( < 1 % ) of these events , respectively , were believed to be related to vaccination . In women older than 25 years , the HPV 16/18 vaccine is efficacious against infections and cervical abnormalities associated with the vaccine types , as well as infections with the non-vaccine HPV types 31 and 45 .

       " \" To describe the predictors of nurse actions in response to a mobile health decision-support system ( mHealth DSS ) for guideline-based screening and management of tobacco use . Observational design focused on an experimental arm of a randomized , controlled trial . Acute and ambulatory care settings in the New York City metropolitan area . 14,115 patient encounters in which 185 RNs enrolled in advanced practice nurse ( APN ) training were prompted by an mHealth DSS to screen for tobacco use and select guideline-based treatment recommendations . Data were entered and stored during nurse documentation in the mHealth DSS and subsequently stored in the study database where they were retrieved for analysis using descriptive statistics and logistic regressions . Predictor variables included patient gender , patient race or ethnicity , patient payer source , APN specialty , and predominant payer source in clinical site . Dependent variables included the number of patient encounters in which the nurse screened for tobacco use , provided smoking cessation teaching and counseling , or referred patients for smoking cessation for patients who indicated a willingness to quit . Screening was more likely to occur in encounters where patients were female , African American , and received care from a nurse in the adult nurse practitioner specialty or in a clinical site in which the predominant payer source was Medicare , Medicaid , or State Children 's Health Insurance Program . In encounters where the patient payer source was other , nurses were less likely to provide tobacco cessation teaching and counseling . mHealth DSS has the potential to affect nurse provision of guideline-based care . However , patient , nurse , and setting factors influence nurse actions in response to an mHealth DSS for tobacco cessation . The combination of a reminder to screen and integration of guideline-based recommendations into the mHealth DSS may reduce racial or ethnic disparities to screening , as well as clinician barriers related to time , training , and familiarity with resources .\",\n",
       " ' Although iron supplementation in malaria-free areas mostly reduces infectious morbidity , it can sometimes increase morbidity from infections as a result of the dependence of pathogenic microorganisms on iron . Supplementation with n-3 ( -3 ) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCPUFAs ) improved morbidity in several human studies . However , information on the combined effect of iron and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on infectious morbidity is limited . We determined whether n-3 LCPUFAs and iron supplementation , alone or in combination , affected absenteeism and illness in iron-deficient schoolchildren with low fish intake . A total of 321 South African children ( aged 6-11 y ) with iron deficiency ( ID ) were randomly divided into 4 groups to receive 1 ) iron plus placebo , 2 ) a mixture of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid ( DHA/EPA ) plus placebo , 3 ) iron plus DHA/EPA , or 4 ) placebo plus placebo as oral supplements 4 times/wk for 8.5 mo. . Morbidity was recorded , and iron-status indexes were measured . The total phospholipid fatty acid composition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell membranes was analyzed in a subsample ( n = 130 ) . Iron supplementation increased the number of days with illness when all symptoms were considered ( B : 0.87 ; 95 % CI : 0.71 , 1.03 ) as well as illness that was specifically caused by respiratory symptoms ( B : 1.45 ; 95 % CI : 1.21 , 1.70 ) , whereas DHA/EPA reduced the number of days with illness at school ( B : -0.96 ; 95 % CI : -1.33 , -0.59 ) . The increases caused by iron were reduced to the levels seen in the placebo plus placebo group when iron was provided in combination with DHA/EPA as indicated by significant iron DHA/EPA interactions ( both P < 0.001 ) . Iron supplementation increased morbidity ( mostly respiratory ) in iron-deficient South African schoolchildren with low DHA/EPA intake , but when iron was given in combination with DHA/EPA , this effect was prevented .',\n",
       " ' Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) is a serious disorder with high rates of morbidity and mortality . Family-based treatment ( FBT ) is an evidence-based therapy for adolescent AN , but less than half of those who receive this approach recover . Hence , it is important to identify other approaches to prevent the development of the chronic form of AN for which there is no known evidence-based treatment . To compare FBT with systemic family therapy ( SyFT ) for the treatment of adolescent-onset AN . Research in Anorexia Nervosa ( RIAN ) is a 2-group ( FBT and SyFT ) randomized trial conducted between September 2005 and April 2012 . Interviewers were blinded to the treatment condition . A total of 564 adolescents receiving care at 6 outpatient clinics experienced in the treatment of AN were screened . Of these , 262 adolescents did not meet the inclusion criteria and 138 declined to participate ; hence , 164 adolescents ( aged 12-18 years ) of both sexes meeting the criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , AN ( except for amenorrhea ) were enrolled . Three participants were withdrawn from FBT and 7 were withdrawn from SyFT after serious adverse events occurred . Two manualized family therapies with 16 one-hour sessions during 9 months . Family-based therapy focuses on the facilitation of weight gain , whereas SyFT addresses general family processes . The primary outcomes were percentage of ideal body weight ( IBW ) and remission ( 95 % of IBW ) . The a priori hypothesis was that FBT would result in faster weight gain early in treatment and at the end of treatment ( EOT ) . There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the primary outcome , for eating disorder symptoms or comorbid psychiatric disorders at the EOT or follow-up . Remission rates included FBT , 33.1 % at the EOT and 40.7 % at follow-up and SyFT , 25.3 % and 39.0 % , respectively . Family-based therapy led to significantly faster weight gain early in treatment , significantly fewer days in the hospital , and lower treatment costs per patient in remission at the EOT ( FBT , $ 8963 ; SyFT , $ 18005 ) . An exploratory moderator analysis found that SyFT led to greater weight gain than did FBT for participants with more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms . The findings of this study suggest that FBT is the preferred treatment for adolescent AN because it is not significantly different from SyFT and leads to similar outcomes at a lower cost than SyFT . Adolescents with more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms may receive more benefits with SyFT . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT00610753 .',\n",
       " ' The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of structured education in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patients . In a 16-week open-label randomized controlled study , 1511 T2DM patients with inadequate responses to two or more oral antidiabetic drugs ( OADs ) for > 3 months ( HbA1c > 7.5 % ) were randomized ( 1:1 ) to either an education group ( structured diabetes education plus insulin therapy ) or a control group ( usual care plus insulin therapy ) . Both groups discontinued previous OADs ( except biguanides and - glucosidase inhibitors ) and started twice daily injections of 30 % soluble-70 % isophane recombinant insulin . The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline . Efficacy and safety data were analyzed for within - and between-group differences . Of the initial 1511 patients , 1289 completed the study ( 643 in the control group ; 646 in the education group ) . At the end of the study , significant reductions in HbA1c versus baseline were evident in both groups , but the reduction was greater in the education group ( 2.16 % vs. 2.08 % ; P < 0.05 ) . A higher proportion of patients in the education group achieved target HbA1c levels < 7 % ( 43.81 % vs. 36.86 % ; P < 0.05 ) and 6.5 % ( 28.48 % vs. 22.71 % ; P < 0.05 ) . In addition , patients in the education group showed greater increments in scores and improvement in the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale ( P < 0.05 ) . The overall incidence of hypoglycemic events was similar in the two groups .

       " ' The present study is a comparison of two point-of-care ( POC ) tests as endpoints of protamine titration after CPB . The authors hypothesized that using the heparinase-kaolin thromboelastography ( TEG-HK ) R-time difference would more readily identify residual heparin necessitating additional protamine than when using activated coagulation time ( ACT ) . The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in protamine dose . Whether this approach would lessen postoperative bleeding and sequelae also was investigated . Single center , blinded , prospective , randomized study . University teaching hospital . Eighty-two adult patients for on-pump coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery . Patients were randomized . In the ACT group , protamine was titrated until ACT did not exceed baseline by more than 10 % . In the TEG group , a TEG-HK R-time difference less than 20 % was targeted . Protamine was repeated to achieve the endpoints . Clinicians in the ACT group were blinded to TEG data and vice versa . There was no between-group difference in total protamine dose ( 3.9 0.6 and 4.2 0.7 ; 95 % CI of the difference between means : -0.544 to 0.008 mg/kg ; p = 0.057 ) or protamine : heparin ratios ( 1.3:1 and 1.4:1 ; 95 % CI of the difference between means : -0.05 to 0.03 mg/mg ; p = 0.653 ) . In the ACT group , 17 % of patients required a second protamine dose , and in the TEG group , 24 % of patients required a second protamine dose . No between-group differences in the postoperative transfusion requirements or intensive care unit length of stay were demonstrated . No difference was identified in protamine dosing using either ACT or TEG-HK R-time difference as endpoints . Heparinase TEG may be useful for monitoring heparin reversal .',\n",
       " ' Clinical practice guidelines are considered important instruments to improve quality of care . However , success is dependent on adherence , which may be improved using peer assessment , a strategy in which professionals assess performance of their peers in a simulated setting . The aim of this study was to determine whether peer assessment is more effective than case-based discussions to improve knowledge and guideline-consistent clinical reasoning in the Dutch physical therapy guideline for low back pain ( LBP ) . A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted . Ten communities of practice ( CoPs ) of physical therapists were cluster randomized ( N = 90 ) : 6 CoPs in the peer-assessment group ( n = 49 ) and 4 CoPs in the case-based discussion group ( control group ) ( n = 41 ) . Both groups participated in 4 educational sessions and used clinical patient cases . The peer-assessment group reflected on performed LBP management in different roles . The control group used structured discussions . Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 6 months . The primary outcome measure was knowledge and guideline-consistent reasoning , measured with 12 performance indicators using 4 vignettes with specific guideline-related patient profiles . For each participant , the total score was calculated by adding up the percentage scores ( 0-100 ) per vignette , divided by 4 . The secondary outcome measure was reflective practice , as measured by the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale ( 20-100 ) . Vignettes were completed by 78 participants ( 87 % ) . Multilevel analysis showed an increase in guideline-consistent clinical reasoning of 8.4 % in the peer-assessment group , whereas the control group showed a decline of 0.1 % ( estimated group difference = 8.7 % , 95 % confidence interval = 3.9 to 13.4 ) . No group differences were found on self-reflection . The small sample size , a short-term follow-up , and the use of vignettes as a proxy for behavior were limitations of the study .

The pathogenic mechanisms of eczema are still not fully understood , and current treatment of moderate-severe eczema is often difficult . Recently , it has been suggested that Vitamin D plays a key role in this disease , even if mechanisms are only partially known . The purpose of our study was to assess the 25-Hydroxyvitamin D serum levels in a pediatric population suffering from chronic eczema ( IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated ) , and to correlate these phenotypes with the SCORAD severity and selected clinical and biological parameters . Moreover , we aimed to evaluate whether a supplementation of Vitamin D3 could affect the same clinical and laboratory parameters . 89 children with chronic eczema were enrolled in the study . Severity of eczema was assessed with the SCORAD index . Past and present history was taken , and patients were divided into two groups according to the state of sensitization . According to a randomization schedule , the enrolled children were assigned to the following groups : supplementation group , which received a daily oral Vitamin D3 supplementation ( 2000 IUs ) for 3 months ; control group which received no supplementation . Vitamin D concentrations in patients with moderate and severe eczema were not statistically different from Vitamin D concentration detected in the serum of patients with mild eczema . Furthermore , we did not find any correlation between Vitamin D levels , total IgEs and SCORAD index , both in the Sensitized and in the Not-Sensitized group . The Vitamin D3 supplementation did not influence the SCORAD severity or the total IgEs concentration . To our knowledge , our study is the first one that shows no correlation between serum levels of Vitamin D , eczema severity and IgE sensitization in a pediatric population suffering from chronic eczema .',\n",

The CC/PD was guided by the four bioethical principles . We used a multimedia approach , including one-way communications ( newspaper ads , brochures , television , radio , and web ) and two-way communications ( interactive in-person presentations at community meetings , printed and online feedback forms ) to reach the trials catchment area ( Denver County 's population : 643,000 and the Denver larger metro area where commuters reside : 2.9 million ) . Particular attention was given to special-interests groups ( eg , Jehovah Witnesses , homeless ) and to Spanish-speaking communities ( brochures and presentations in Spanish ) . Opt-out materials were available during on-site presentations or via the COMBAT study website . A total of 227 community organizations were contacted . Brochures were distributed to 11 medical clinics and 3 homeless shelters . The multimedia campaign had the potential to reach an estimated audience of 1.5 million individuals in large metro Denver area , the majority via one-way communication and 1900 in two-way communications . This resource intensive process cost more than $ 84,000 . The CC/PD process is resource-intensive , costly , and complex .

       " ' Patients with bipolar disorder often show decreased adherence with mood stabilizers and frequently interventions on prodromal depressive and manic symptoms are delayed . Recently , the MONARCA I randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of electronic self-monitoring using smartphones on depressive and manic symptoms . The findings suggested that patients using the MONARCA system had more sustained depressive symptoms than patients using a smartphone for normal communicative purposes , but had fewer manic symptoms during the trial . It is likely that the ability of these self-monitored measures to detect prodromal symptoms of depression and mania may be insufficient compared to automatically generated objective data on measures of illness activity such as phone usage , social activity , physical activity , and mobility . The Monsenso system , for smartphones integrating subjective and objective measures of illness activity was developed and will be tested in the present trial . The MONARCA II trial uses a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group design . Patients with bipolar disorder according to ICD-10 who previously have been treated at the Copenhagen Clinic for Affective Disorder , Denmark are included and randomized to either daily use of the Monsenso system including an feedback loop between patients and clinicians ( the intervention group ) or to the use of a smartphone for normal communicative purposes ( the control group ) for a 9-month trial period . The trial was started in September 2014 and recruitment is ongoing . The outcomes are : differences in depressive and manic symptoms ; rate of depressive and manic episodes ( primary ) ; automatically generated objective data on measures of illness activity ; number of days hospitalized ; psychosocial functioning ( secondary ) ; perceived stress ; quality of life ; self-rated depressive symptoms ; self-rated manic symptoms ; recovery ; empowerment and adherence to medication ( tertiary ) between the intervention group and the control group during the trial . Ethical permission has been obtained . Positive , neutral and negative findings will be published .

We aimed to compare two different 5.5 Fr standard sphincterotomes to determine initial cannulation success . Adult patients with naive papillae were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , crossover study . Two different 5.5 Fr sphincterotomes preloaded with guidewire ( GW ) were used in two groups with 140 patients included per group . A total of five papillary attempts and two pancreatic channel entries were allowed as maximum targets . In a case of more than two pancreatic entries , a double GW technique was attempted before crossover . If choledochal cannulation was not achieved within ten papillary attempts or more than four pancreatic entries despite crossover , access papillotomy was performed . Successful biliary cannulation was the primary outcome . Secondary outcomes were incidence of early complications and overall cannulation success . Higher initial cannulation success was achieved in group I compared with group II ( 88.5 vs. 77.1 % , p = 0.011 ) . The crossover and double GW techniques reduced the need for precut from 11.7 to 5.3 % . The overall cannulation success including precut for failed cases was 99.2 % ( group I ) and 98.5 % ( group II ) . Sphincterotome type , presence of crossover , and number of cannulation attempts were predictors of successful cannulation in multivariate analysis . There was a significant difference in cannulation success between two different 5.5 Fr sphincterotomes . The cannulation success was mainly governed by sphincterotome design which serves a proper spatial orientation during the procedure . The combined use of crossover and double GW techniques may substantially decrease precut necessity .',\n",
       " \" Providing written medicine information to consumers enables them to make informed decisions about their medicines , playing an important role in educating and improving health literacy . In Australia , standardized written medicine information called Consumer Medicine Information ( CMI ) is available for medicines as package inserts , computer prints , or leaflets . Consumers want and read CMI , but may not always ask for it . General practitioners ( GPs ) and pharmacists are an important source of written medicine information , yet may not always provide CMI in their practice . To examine and compare the awareness , use and provision of CMI by consumers , pharmacists and general practitioners ( GPs ) . Based on previous studies , structured questionnaires were developed and administered to a national sample of consumers ( phone survey ) ; community pharmacists and GPs ( postal surveys ) about utilization of CMI . Descriptive , comparative and logistic regression analyses were conducted . The respondents comprised of 349 pharmacists , 181 GPs and 1000 consumers . Two-thirds of consumers , nearly all ( 99 % ) pharmacists and 90 % of GPs were aware of CMI . About 88 % of consumers reported receiving CMI as a package insert , however most pharmacists ( 99 % ) and GPs ( 56 % ) reported providing computer-generated CMI . GPs ' and pharmacists ' main reason for providing CMI was on patient request . Reasons for not providing were predominantly because consumers were already taking the medicine , concerns regarding difficulty understanding the information , or potential non-adherence . Of the 691 consumers reportedly reading CMI , 35 % indicated concerns after reading . Factors associated with reading included gender , type of CMI received and frequency of provision . Consumers want and read information about their medicines , especially when received from their GP or pharmacist . Healthcare professionals report usually discussing CMI when providing it to patients , although continued improvements in dissemination rates are desirable . Regular use of CMI remains a challenge , and ongoing strategies to promote CMI use are necessary to improve uptake of CMI in Australia .\",\n",
       " ' The aim of this study was to compare the contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) values of infarct and remote myocardium as well as infarct and blood after application of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol and 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine on late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance ( MR ) images . The study was a prospective randomized controlled clinical study . After informed consent was obtained , 20 patients ( 12 men , 8 women ; mean age , 67 11 years ) with known chronic myocardial infarction were included for an intraindividual comparison of a single-dose gadobutrol and a single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine . Two MR imaging examinations were performed within a period of 28 days in a crossover design . Late gadolinium enhancement imaging was performed 10 minutes after gadolinium administration using a 2-dimensional phase-sensitive inversion recovery gradient echo sequence at 3 T. Infarct size , signal intensities ( SIs ) , signal-to-noise ratio , and CNR were determined on phase-sensitive MR images . Values for CNR were calculated as CNRinfarct/myocardium = ( SIinfarct - SImyocardium ) / SDnoise and CNRinfarct/blood = ( SIinfarct - SIblood ) / SDnoise . In addition , the areas of myocardial infarction were determined on single slices . The entire infarct volumes were calculated by adding the areas with hyperenhancement multiplied by the slice thickness . Late gadolinium enhancement was present in all patients . Median values of the infarct area , infarct volume , and transmurality for gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine showed good to excellent concordance ( rc = 0.85 , rc = 0.95 , and rc = 0.71 , respectively ) . The mean signal-to-noise ratio values for infarct , remote myocardium , and ventricular blood were 18.6 6.5 , 4.1 3.7 , and 14.6 7.5 , respectively , for gadobutrol and 18.8 8.9 , 4.9 4.5 , and 17.8 10.1 , respectively , for gadobenate dimeglumine ( P = 0.93 , P = 0.48 , and P = 0.149 , respectively ) . The mean values of CNRinfarct/myocardium and CNRinfarct/blood were 14.5 5.9 and 4.0 4.6 , respectively , for gadobutrol and 13.9 6.1 and 0.9 4.5 , respectively , for gadobenate dimeglumine ( P = 0.69 and P = 0.02 , respectively ) . Both gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine allow for successful late gadolinium enhancement imaging of chronic myocardial infarction after a single-dose application ( 0.1 mmol/kg ) at 3 T. Gadobutrol provides a higher CNR between infarct and blood . The CNRs between infarct and normal myocardium , infarct size , and transmural extent were similar for both contrast agents .',\n",
       " ' Patients undergoing breast cancer surgery frequently experience chronic postoperative pain . The primary objective of this randomized study was to determine if thoracic paravertebral block ( TPVB ) reduced the incidence of chronic pain after a modified radical mastectomy ( MRM ) when compared with general anesthesia ( GA ) . One hundred eighty women undergoing MRM were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups : group 1 : standardized GA , group 2 : GA with a single-injection TPVB and placebo paravertebral infusion , and group 3 : GA with a continuous TPVB . Outcomes assessed postoperatively included acute postoperative pain and analgesic consumption and , at 3 and 6 months , the incidence and severity of chronic pain and physical and mental health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) . There was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic pain at 3 months ( P = 0.13 ) and 6 months ( P = 0.79 ) after the MRM between the study groups . The relative risk of developing chronic pain ( P = 0.25 ) was also similar between the groups . There was no difference in acute pain ( P = 0.22 ) or postoperative analgesic consumption ( P = 0.67 ) between the groups . Nevertheless , differences were observed in chronic pain-related secondary outcome variables . The TPVB groups reported lower chronic pain scores ( P < 0.05 ) , exhibited fewer symptoms and signs of chronic pain ( P 0.01 ) , and also experienced better physical and mental HRQOL than did the GA group . Chronic pain scores also decreased with time in all study groups ( P < 0.05 ) . There is no significant difference in the incidence or relative risk of chronic pain at 3 and 6 months after an MRM when TPVB is used in conjunction with GA. . Nevertheless , patients who receive a TPVB report less severe chronic pain , exhibit fewer symptoms and signs of chronic pain , and also experience better physical and mental HRQOL .',\n",
       " ' Narrative exposure therapy ( NET ) is a brief , manualised treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . It has been shown to have therapeutic benefits for a wide range of individuals and settings . This study , following our previous work applying the original NET in earthquake survivors , aimed to revise NET to be adaptable for treating PTSD after a natural disaster . A randomised waiting-list controlled study was conducted with 30 adult participants with PTSD who were randomly allocated to NET ( n = 10 ) , revised NET ( NET-R ; n = 10 ) or a waiting list condition ( WL ; n = 10 ) . Participants in NET and NET-R received treatment immediately ; those in the WL condition received NET-R treatment after a waiting period . All groups were assessed on PTSD , general distress , anxiety , depression , social support , coping and posttraumatic change before and after treatment and three-month follow-up . Compared with WL , both NET and NET-R groups showed significant reductions in PTSD and related symptoms . Significant increases were found in posttraumatic growth , active coping and perceived social support . The WL group showed similar improvements after treatment . Further reductions on PTSD symptoms were found at three months , showing that NET-R is as effective as the original NET in treating post-earthquake traumatic symptoms in adult Chinese earthquake survivors . NET-R is a feasible and cost-effective intervention for Chinese earthquake survivors . Further studies are needed to replicate these findings in other survivor populations , and with larger samples and over longer periods . This study highlighted the value of oral narrative approach , which is well-accepted and useful in the context of single natural disaster and lower - income area .

       " ' The objective of the study was to test the diagnostic performance of low-dose computed tomography pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) at peak tube voltage of 80 kVp with both reduced radiation and reduced contrast material ( CM ) dose . In this single-center , single-blinded prospective randomized trial , 501 patients with body weights of less than 100 kg with suspected acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) were assigned to normal-dose CTPA ( 100-kVp tube energy and 100-mL CM , 255 patients ) and low-dose CTPA ( 80-kVp tube energy and 75-mL CM , 246 patients ) . Primary end points were evidence of PE in CTPA and accuracy of CTPA on a composite reference standard . Results were compared by calculating the odds ratio with the 95 % confidence interval . The reference diagnosis was equivocal in 20 of the 501 patients . Diagnosis of CTPA was correct in 240 patients and incorrect in 5 in the normal-dose group . Computed tomography pulmonary angiography was correct in 230 patients and incorrect in 6 in the low-dose group ( odds ratio , 1.25 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.38-4 .16 ; P = 0.77 ) . Sensitivity was 96.9 % and 100 % and specificity was 98.1 % and 97.1 % in the normal-dose and low-dose groups , respectively . No PE or PE-related death occurred during the 90-day follow-up . The size-specific dose estimates were 30 % lower at 80 kVp ( 4.8 1.0 mGy ) compared with that at 100 kVp ( 6.8 1.2 mGy ; P < 0.001 ) . The accuracy of low-dose CTPA at 80 kVp with a 30 % reduced radiation dose and a 25 % lower CM volume is not significantly different from that of normal-dose CTPA at 100 kVp in detecting acute PE in patients weighing less than 100 kg .',\n",
       " ' To evaluate the association of subretinal hyperreflective material ( SHRM ) with visual acuity ( VA ) , geographic atrophy ( GA ) , and scar in the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials ( CATT ) . Prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial . The 1185 CATT participants . Masked readers graded scar and GA on fundus photography and fluorescein angiography and graded SHRM on time-domain and spectral-domain ( SD ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) throughout 104 weeks . Measurements of SHRM height and width in the fovea , within the center 1 mm ( 2 ) , or outside the center 1mm ( 2 ) were obtained on SD OCT images at 56 ( n = 76 ) and 104 ( n = 66 ) weeks . Presence of SHRM , as well as location and size , and associations with VA , scar , and GA. . Among CATT participants , the percentage with SHRM at enrollment was 77 % , decreasing to 68 % at 4 weeks after treatment and to 54 % at 104 weeks . At 104 weeks , scar was present more often in eyes with persistent SHRM than in eyes with SHRM that resolved ( 64 % vs. 31 % ; P < 0.0001 ) . Among eyes with detailed evaluation of SHRM at weeks 56 ( n = 76 ) and 104 ( n = 66 ) , mean VA letter score was 73.5 ( standard error [ SE ] , 2.8 ) , 73.1 ( SE , 3.4 ) , 65.3 ( SE , 3.5 ) , and 63.9 ( SE , 3.7 ) when SHRM was absent , present outside the central 1 mm ( 2 ) , present within the central 1 mm ( 2 ) but not the foveal center , or present at the foveal center ( P = 0.02 ) , respectively . When SHRM was present , the median maximum height under the fovea , within the central 1 mm ( 2 ) including the fovea and anywhere within the scan , was 86 m , 120 m , and 122 m , respectively . Visual acuity was decreased with greater SHRM height and width ( P < 0.05 ) . In eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , SHRM is common and often persists after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment . At 2 years , eyes with scar were more likely to have SHRM than other eyes . Greater SHRM dimensions were associated with worse VA. . In eyes with neovascular AMD , SHRM is an important morphologic biomarker .',\n",
       " ' A phase 3 randomized clinical trial was designed to test whether bardoxolone methyl , a nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) activator , slows progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus . The trial was terminated because of an increase in heart failure in the bardoxolone methyl group ; many of the events were clinically associated with fluid retention . We randomized 2,185 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 to < 30 mL min ( -1 ) 1.73 m ( -2 ) ) to once-daily bardoxolone methyl ( 20 mg ) or placebo . We used classification and regression tree analysis to identify baseline factors predictive of heart failure or fluid overload events . Elevated baseline B-type natriuretic peptide and previous hospitalization for heart failure were identified as predictors of heart failure events ; bardoxolone methyl increased the risk of heart failure by 60 % in patients with these risk factors . For patients without these baseline characteristics , the risk for heart failure events among bardoxolone methyl - and placebo-treated patients was similar ( 2 % ) . The same risk factors were also identified as predictors of fluid overload and appeared to be related to other serious adverse events . Bardoxolone methyl contributed to events related to heart failure and/or fluid overload in a subpopulation of susceptible patients with an increased risk for heart failure at baseline . Careful selection of participants and vigilant monitoring of the study drug will be required in any future trials of bardoxolone methyl to mitigate the risk of heart failure and other serious adverse events .',\n",

       " ' The administration of statins seems to be a promising new avenue in the treatment of patients suffering from major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , though patients suffering from severe MDD remain unstudied in this respect . The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate , in a randomized double-blind clinical trial , the influence of adjuvant atorvastatin on symptoms of depression in patients with MDD . A total of 60 patients suffering from MDD ( mean age : 32.25 years ; 53 % males ) received a standard medication of 40 mg/d citalopram . Next , patients were randomly assigned either to the atorvastatin group ( 20 mg/d ) or to the placebo group . Blood lipid values were assessed at baseline and on completion of the study 12 weeks later . Experts rated depressive symptoms via Hamilton Depression Rating Scales ( HDRS ) at baseline and 3 , 6 and 12 weeks later . HDRS scores decreased over time ; the significant Time by Group interaction showed that symptoms of depression decreased more in the atorvastatin than in the placebo group . Compared to the placebo group , in the atorvastatin group cholesterol , triglyceride , and Low Density Lipids ( LDL ) significantly decreased , and High Density Lipids ( HDL ) significantly increased over time . HDRS scores and blood lipid values were generally not associated . The pattern of results suggests that adjuvant atorvastatin favorably influences symptoms of depression among patients with severe MDD . Given that after 12 weeks of monotherapy and adjuvant atorvastatin patients were still moderately to severely depressed , more powerful treatment algorithms such as augmentation and change of medication are highly recommended .',\n",
       " \" To compare measurement properties of the P4 pain scale , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index pain subscale ( WOMAC-pain ) , and Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain ( ICOAP ) measure in patients with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . A secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial included participants ( n = 156 ) with knee OA that were consulting with a surgeon regarding knee arthroplasty . They completed pain measures ( P4 , WOMAC-pain , ICOAP ) and WOMAC-function subscale ( WOMAC-function ) at baseline and 2 weeks . Measurement properties assessed in various subgroups included floor/ceiling effects , test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC2 ,1 ) , internal consistency using Cronbach 's , factorial structure of each pain measure combined with WOMAC-function using principal component analysis , and responsiveness using standardized response mean ( SRM ) . P4 had low floor and ceiling effects ( < 1 % ) . P4 test-retest reliability ( ICC2 ,1 = 0.72 ) , internal consistency ( Chronbach 's = 0.91 ) , and responsiveness ( SRM = 0.56 ) were similar to the values for WOMAC-pain and ICOAP . Factorial structure of P4 and ICOAP were separate from WOMAC-function items . WOMAC-pain and WOMAC-function items loaded on similar factors . ICOAP-constant subscale had a large floor effect ( 33 % ) . P4 should be used to measure pain in patients with knee OA . It had acceptable measurement properties which is comparable to more widely used pain measures . WOMAC-pain shared a factorial structure with WOMAC-function indicating these measures might be capturing the same construct , questioning its validity to measure pain separately from function . ICOAP had acceptable properties . More work should compare pain measures in less severely affected OA populations .\",\n",
       " ' Individuals with a history of recurrent depression have a high risk of repeated depressive relapse or recurrence . Maintenance antidepressants for at least 2 years is the current recommended treatment , but many individuals are interested in alternatives to medication . Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) has been shown to reduce risk of relapse or recurrence compared with usual care , but has not yet been compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in a definitive trial . We aimed to see whether MBCT with support to taper or discontinue antidepressant treatment ( MBCT-TS ) was superior to maintenance antidepressants for prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence over 24 months . In this single-blind , parallel , group randomised controlled trial ( PREVENT ) , we recruited adult patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes and on a therapeutic dose of maintenance antidepressants , from primary care general practices in urban and rural settings in the UK . Participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT-TS or maintenance antidepressants ( in a 1:1 ratio ) with a computer-generated random number sequence with stratification by centre and symptomatic status . Participants were aware of treatment allocation and research assessors were masked to treatment allocation . The primary outcome was time to relapse or recurrence of depression , with patients followed up at five separate intervals during the 24-month study period . The primary analysis was based on the principle of intention to treat . The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials , ISRCTN26666654 . Between March 23 , 2010 , and Oct 21 , 2011 , we assessed 2188 participants for eligibility and recruited 424 patients from 95 general practices . 212 patients were randomly assigned to MBCT-TS and 212 to maintenance antidepressants . The time to relapse or recurrence of depression did not differ between MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants over 24 months ( hazard ratio 089 , 95 % CI 067-118 ; p = 043 ) , nor did the number of serious adverse events . Five adverse events were reported , including two deaths , in each of the MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants groups . No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial . We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals at risk for depressive relapse or recurrence .

The assessment of the scale was performed as a nested study within a randomised controlled trial of two creams used for radiation therapy skin care for breast cancer patients . The sample consisted of 244 female patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer . Participants completed a modified version of the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale . Internal consistency as measured by Cronbach 's alpha was 0.505 , 0.829 and 0.339 for the Genetic Disposition , Sun Exposure and Tanning Habits subscales respectively . Only the Sun Exposure subscale surpassed the 0.70 cut-off , indicating good internal consistency . Maximum likelihood factor analysis with promax rotation method confirmed the a priori factor structure for the Sun Exposure subscale as well as providing evidence of construct validity for this subscale . Analysis for the other two subscales highlighted issues with internal reliability and construct validity suggesting that not all items on each subscale truly measure the intended trait . The study findings support reliability and validity of the Sun Exposure subscale of the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale in a convenience sample of women receiving radiation therapy for cancer .

We have hypothesized that a combination of articaine and ropivacaine provides faster onset and even an early recovery of sensory-motor block characteristics . Sixty term parturients scheduled to have elective cesarean section were randomly allocated into three groups to receive either 20 mL 2 % articaine ( Group A ) , 10 mL 2 % articaine + 10 mL 0.75 % ropivacaine ( Group AR ) or 20 mL 0.75 % ropivacaine ( Group R ) via lumbar epidural catheter . The onset time of sensory block to T10 , T6 and maximum sensory block level , time to two segments regression from maximum sensory block level , onset time and duration of motor block were all recorded . Intraoperative and postoperative additional analgesic requirements were also recorded . Demographic data were similar . The onset times of sensorial block to T10 and T6 were significantly shorter in Groups A and AR in comparison with Group R ( p < 0.05 ) . The onset times of motor block were similar in all groups , but a more intense motor block was observed in Group R ( p < 0.05 ) . Two segments regression time and motor block durations were significantly shorter in Groups A and AR in comparison with Group R ( p < 0.05 ) . Intraoperative supplementary analgesic requirements were higher in Group A than in the other two groups ( p < 0.05 ) . A combination of 2 % articaine and 0.75 % ropivacaine for epidural anesthesia in a cesarean section should be preferred over epidural 0.75 % ropivacaine alone .',\n",

The purpose of these pilot studies was to determine whether cigarettes with different levels of nicotine but similar tar levels would affect sensory experience or smoking behavior so as to significantly alter levels of selected biomarkers of exposure ( BOE ) . In 2 confined , double-blind studies , 120 adult smokers switched from Marlboro Gold cigarettes at baseline to either 1 of 2 lower nicotine cigarettes or 1 of 2 higher nicotine cigarettes and then to the other cigarette after 5 days . Urinary excretion of exposure biomarkers ( nicotine equivalents [ NE ] , total and free 4 - ( methylnitrosamino ) -1 - ( 3-pyridyl ) -1 - butanol [ NNAL ] , 1-hydroxypyrene , and 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid ) as well as carboxyhemoglobin and plasma cotinine were measured at baseline , Day 5 , and Day 10 . Daily cigarette consumption was monitored and sensory characteristics were rated for each cigarette . With higher nicotine yield , urine NE , urine total NNAL , and plasma cotinine increased while nonnicotine BOE decreased without changes in cigarette consumption . In contrast , with lower nicotine yield , urine NE , urine total NNAL , and plasma cotinine dropped while nonnicotine BOE and cigarettes per day increased . Higher nicotine cigarettes were rated harsher and stronger than at baseline while lower nicotine cigarettes were less strong . All 4 test cigarettes were highly disliked . These studies demonstrate that abrupt increases or decreases in nicotine and the resulting sensory changes impact BOE through changes in intensity or frequency of smoking .',\n",

Imaging was performed at baseline and at follow-up months 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 , including autofluorescence ( AF ) imaging with a fundus camera-based flash system ( TRC-50DX ; Topcon Medical Systems , Oakland , NJ ; AF excitation : 535-585 nm ; detection : 605-715 nm ) , AF and fluorescein angiography ( FA ) imaging with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( SLO ) system ( Spectralis ; Heidelberg Engineering , Heidelberg , Germany ; AF excitation : 488 nm ; detection : > 500 nm ) , and SD-OCT en face imaging ( Cirrus ; Carl Zeiss Meditec , Dublin , CA ) . Average baseline square root measurements and enlargement rates of square root areas appeared similar across all modalities ; 0.2 mm was the largest difference between any pair of measurement means . The intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC ) were essentially equal to 1 for all comparisons of area measurements but were lower for growth rates than area measurements . Comparison of 26-week average enlargement rates showed no significant difference between the SLO AF image and enhanced SD-OCT en face image ( mean difference : 0.01 mm ; SD : 0.10 ; P = .70 ) . Agreement among all imaging modalities in measuring the areas of GA at baseline diminished when the growth rates of GA were compared over 26 weeks , likely because each imaging technique identifies different anatomic features along the border of GA , which may appear similar but change at different rates .',\n",
       " ' Red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion is frequently used to treat women with acute anaemia after postpartum haemorrhage . We aimed to assess the economic consequences of red blood cell transfusion compared to non-intervention in these women . A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed alongside the Well-Being of Obstetric patients on Minimal Blood transfusions ( WOMB ) trial . Women with acute anaemia [ Hb 48-79g / dl ( 30-49mm ) ] after postpartum haemorrhage , without severe anaemic symptoms , were randomly allocated to RBC transfusion or non-intervention . Primary outcome of the trial was physical fatigue ( Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory , scale 4-20 ; 20 represents maximal fatigue ) . Total costs per arm were calculated using a hospital perspective with a 6weeks time horizon . Per woman , mean costs in the RBC transfusion arm ( n = 258 ) were 1957 compared to 1708 in the non-intervention arm ( n = 261 ; P = 0024 ) . The 13 % difference in costs between study arms predominantly originated from costs of RBC units , as costs of RBC units were six times higher in the RBC transfusion arm . RBC transfusion led to a small improvement in physical fatigue of 058 points per day ; thus , the costs to improve the physical fatigue score with one point would be 431 . In women with acute anaemia after postpartum haemorrhage ( PPH ) , RBC transfusion is on average 249 more expensive per woman than non-intervention , with only a small gain in HRQoL after RBC transfusion . Taking both clinical and economic consequences into account , implementation of a non-intervention policy seems justified .',\n",
       " ' Regular endotracheal tube cuff monitoring may prevent silent aspiration . We hypothesised that active management of the cuff of the tracheal tube during deep hypothermic cardiac arrest would reduce silent subglottic aspiration . We also determined to study its effect on postoperative mechanical ventilation and the incidence of postoperative positive tracheal cultures . A randomised clinical trial . The study was conducted in a University Teaching Hospital from September 2008 to November 2009 . Twenty-four patients undergoing elective pulmonary endarterectomy were included in the study . After induction of general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation , the cuff of the tracheal tube was inflated to 25cmH2O . Following this , 1ml of methylene blue dye diluted in 2ml of physiological saline was injected into the hypopharynx . Patients were randomly assigned to active cuff management during cooling and warming ( where cuff pressure was monitored and the cuff was reinflated if it dropped below 20cmH2O , or deflated if pressure exceeded 30cmH2O ) or passive monitoring ( where cuff pressure was monitored but volume was not altered ) . Before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass , fibreoptic bronchoscopy was performed . Silent aspiration was then diagnosed if blue dye was seen in the trachea below the cuff of the tube . The primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of silent aspiration . Secondary outcomes included duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation of the lungs and incidence of positive culture of tracheal aspirate . Active cuff management patients were younger than controls ( 51.211.6 vs. 63.29 years , P = 0.028 ) , but otherwise the two groups were similar . The primary endpoint was reached because we showed that silent aspiration was significantly less frequent in the study group ( 0/12 vs. 8/12 patients , P = 0.001 ) . Significantly lower intracuff pressures were measured in the control group patients at several timepoints during cooling , just before hypothermic arrest and at all timepoints during rewarming . We recommend that the cuff of the tracheal tube should be checked regularly during surgery under deep hypothermia , and the cuff pressure adjusted as required .',\n",
       " ' Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Skin reactions are the most common side effects of cetuximab . Rhagades of the tips of the fingers and toes , the heels and especially the interphalangeal joints are one of the most frightening and painful dermatological side effects that may develop from EGFR-inhibitor therapy . Rhagades are characterized by pain , severe tenderness and poor healing response . They are challenging to treat . Thus , rhagades often poses the most significant threat to the quality of life ( QoL ) for these patients . Ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate ( ECA ) , an ethyl ester of the 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid , is often used as adhesive in a variety of different work settings in industry , i.e. as a component in nail-care products such as nail glue . In addition , ECA is used for various medical indications , such as for liquid bandages and for suture-less surgery . Wound healing can be accelerated with ECA . The purpose of the SUPPORT trial is to investigate the efficacy of ECA for the treatment of cetuximab-induced rhagades and to assess the clinical usefulness of the SUPO score , a new classification system for rhagades induced by EGFR-inhibitor therapy . The SUPPORT trial is an open-label , prospective , randomized , national multicenter intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of ECA versus the standard treatment of each institution on the pain intensity and QoL in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer suffering from painful cetuximab-induced rhagades during radioimmunotherapy . Primary endpoint is the assessment of the pain intensity 24 hours after application of ECA or the standard treatment quantified by the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Secondary endpoints are the evaluation of QoL assessed by the EORTC-QoL-C30 questionnaire and the Dermatological Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) . During treatment with EGFR inhibitors it is necessary to recognize and manage side effects promptly to assure better patient QoL . The SUPPORT trial is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating a new treatment option for painful cetuximab-induced rhagades . Furthermore , the new SUPO score will be prospectively assessed in terms of clinical usefulness for classification of EGFR inhibitor-induced rhagades . Current Controlled Trials NCT01693159 .',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study was to characterize cardiac reactivity measures , heart rate ( HR ) , and heart rate variability ( HRV ) , following acute intravenous ( IV ) alcohol administration and their association with subjective responses in social drinkers . Twenty-four subjects ( 11 females ) received IV alcohol infusions to attain and clamp the breath alcohol concentration ( BrAC ) at 50 mg % or placebo in separate sessions . Serial 5-minute cardiac recordings at baseline and during the infusion were analyzed to obtain frequency and time domain cardiac measures . Self-reported subjective perceptions were also obtained at the same time points . HR showed significant decreases from baseline , while the HRV measure pNN50 showed steady increases during the ascending phase of alcohol infusion . HR was inversely correlated with pNN50 across time and treatment . There was a significant association of HR with subjective feelings of high , intoxication , feeling drug effects , and liking drug effects across time during the ascending phase . Acute IV alcohol resulted in decreases in HR and increases in HRV consistent with autonomic parasympathetic activation . The association of these changes with subjective responses suggests that cardiac reactivity may serve as a physiological marker of subjective alcohol effects . This study broadens the understanding of acute cardiovascular effects of alcohol and clinically significant cardiac conditions such as arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy associated with chronic alcohol drinking .',\n",
       " ' A 5-h phase advance model of insomnia was used to evaluate the efficacy of lorediplon , a new non-benzodiazepine hypnotic . Thirty-five male , healthy subjects were included in a five-way randomized cross-over study . During each of the periods , sleep was recorded , and residual effects were measured . All subjects received lorediplon 1 , 5 , and 10 mg , placebo , and zolpidem 10 mg ( i.e. , active control ) . Polysomnographic evaluation revealed that lorediplon ( 5 and 10 mg ) significantly decreased wake after sleep onset ( WASO ) and increased total sleep time . Analysis by quarters of the night showed a progressive increasing effectiveness of lorediplon 10 mg across the first three quarters . Lorediplon increased non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep and stage N2 sleep in the second and third quarters . The magnitude of these effects was dose related , with minimal effects seen with 1 mg . No residual effects were observed 13 h post dose . Lorediplon demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in sleep , whereas zolpidem showed a more sustained WASO effect . No next-day hangover effects were observed . These sleep effects are also consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of lorediplon . These results warrant clinical trials in patients with insomnia .',\n",
       " \" Whether adiposity indicators other than body mass index ( BMI ) should be used in studies of childhood asthma is largely unknown . The role of atopy in `` obese asthma '' is also unclear . To examine the relationship among adiposity indicators , asthma , and atopy in Puerto Rican children , and to assess whether atopy mediates the obesity-asthma association . In a study of Puerto Rican children with ( n = 351 ) and without ( n = 327 ) asthma , we measured BMI , percent of body fat , waist circumference , and waist-to-hip ratio . The outcomes studied included asthma , lung function , measures of atopy , and , among cases , indicators of asthma severity or control . We performed mediation analysis to assess the contribution of atopy to the relationship between adiposity and asthma . BMI , percent of body fat , and waist circumference were associated with increased odds of asthma . Among cases , all 3 measures were generally associated with lung function , asthma severity/control , and atopy ; however , there were differences depending on the adiposity indicator analyzed . Atopy considerably mediated the adiposity-asthma association in this population : allergic rhinitis accounted for 22 % to 53 % of the association with asthma , and sensitization to cockroach mediated 13 % to 20 % of the association with forced vital capacity and 29 % to 42 % of the association with emergency department visits for asthma . Adiposity indicators are associated with asthma , asthma severity/control , and atopy in Puerto Rican children . Atopy significantly mediates the effect of adiposity on asthma outcomes . Longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate the causal role , if any , of adiposity distribution and atopy on `` obese asthma '' in childhood .\",\n",
       " \" Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin might positively affect pregnancy outcomes , but this possibility has not been adequately assessed . Our aim was to investigate whether low-dose aspirin improved livebirth rates in women with one to two previous pregnancy losses . In this multicentre , block-randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , women aged 18-40 years who were attempting to become pregnant were recruited from four medical centres in the USA . Participants were stratified by eligibility criteria -- the original stratum was restricted to women with one loss at less than 20 weeks ' gestation during the previous year , whereas the expanded stratum included women with one to two previous losses , with no restrictions on gestational age or time of loss . Women were block-randomised by centre and eligibility stratum in a 1:1 ratio . Preconception-initiated daily low-dose aspirin ( 81 mg per day ) plus folic acid was compared with placebo plus folic acid for up to six menstrual cycles ; for women who conceived , study treatment continued until 36 weeks ' gestation . Participants , trial staff , and investigators were masked to the assigned treatment . The primary outcome was livebirth rate , which was analysed by intention to treat . The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00467363 . Overall , 1228 women were recruited and randomly assigned between June 15 , 2007 , and July 15 , 2011 , 1078 of whom completed the trial and were included in the analysis ( 535 in the low-dose aspirin group and 543 in the placebo group ) . 309 ( 58 % ) women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths , compared with 286 ( 53 % ) in the placebo group ( p = 00984 ; absolute difference in livebirth rate 509 % [ 95 % CI -084 to 1102 ] ) . Pregnancy loss occurred in 68 ( 13 % ) women in the low-dose aspirin group , compared with 65 ( 12 % ) women in the placebo group ( p = 07812 ) . In the original stratum , 151 ( 62 % ) of 242 women in the low-dose aspirin group had livebirths , compared with 133 ( 53 % ) of 250 in the placebo group ( p = 00446 ; absolute difference in livebirth rate 920 % [ 051 to 1789 ] ) . In the expanded stratum , 158 ( 54 % ) of 293 women in the low-dose aspirin group and 153 ( 52 % ) of 293 in the placebo group had livebirths ( p = 07406 ; absolute difference in livebirth rate 171 % [ -637 to 979 ] ) . Major adverse events were similar between treatment groups . Low-dose aspirin was associated with increased vaginal bleeding , but this adverse event was not associated with pregnancy loss . Preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin was not significantly associated with livebirth or pregnancy loss in women with one to two previous losses . However , higher livebirth rates were seen in women with a single documented loss at less than 20 weeks ' gestation during the previous year . Low-dose aspirin is not recommended for the prevention of pregnancy loss .

       " ' To evaluate intereye corneal asymmetry in Pentacam ( Oculus Optikgerte GmbH , Wetzlar , Germany ) indices as a diagnostic method between normal patients and patients with keratoconus . A retrospective , observational case series of 177 healthy , 44 indeterminate , and 121 patients with keratoconus classified by Pentacam ectasia detection indices , randomized to analysis and validation datasets . Intereye asymmetry in 20 Scheimpflug tomography corneal descriptors was calculated and compared to develop diagnostic models . Intereye asymmetry was not correlated with anisometropia in healthy controls but was correlated with the ectasia grade of the worse eye in patients with keratoconus . Patients with keratoconus had significantly greater intereye asymmetry in all descriptors except for relational thickness indices . Intereye asymmetry in front elevation at the thinnest corneal location afforded the single highest diagnostic performance ( 71 % sensitivity and 85 % specificity ) , whereas the best multivariate model combining intereye asymmetry in anterior and posterior keratometry , corneal thickness , and front and back elevation at the thinnest point provided 65 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity . Multivariate models upheld their performance in the validation dataset . Most ( more than 90 % ) indeterminate patients , according to conventional Pentacam analysis , showed within-normal-range corneal asymmetry . Healthy corneas are markedly symmetric irrespective of anisometropia , but corneal asymmetry analysis does not provide sufficient sensitivity to be used alone for detecting keratoconus . However , its remarkable specificity suggests that it could be used combined with conventional single cornea Pentacam analysis to reduce the false-positive rate or in dubious cases .',\n",

The primary outcome was overall motor severity . Secondary outcomes included other motor measures , balance , cognition , fatigue , apathy , depression and quality of life . On the primary intention-to-treat analysis there was no difference in motor severity between groups MDS-UPDRS-3 ( 1.6 vs.1.2-point reduction , p = 0.85 ) . Patient-rated clinical global impression of change did not differ ( p = 0.33 ) , however examiner rating improved in favor of tango ( p = 0.02 ) . Mini-BESTest improved in the tango group compared to controls ( 0.72.2 vs. -2.75.9 , p = 0.032 ) . Among individual items , tango improved in both simple TUG time ( -1.31.6 s vs. 0.12.3 , p = 0.042 ) and TUG Dual Task score ( 0.40.9 vs. -0.20.4 , p = 0.012 ) , with borderline improvement in walk with pivot turns ( 0.20.5 vs. -0.10.5 , p = 0.066 ) . MoCa ( 0.41.6 vs. -0.61.5 , p = 0.080 ) and FSS ( -3.610.5 vs. 2.56.2 , p = 0.057 ) showed a non-significant trend toward improvement in the tango group . Tango participants found the activity more enjoyable ( p < 0.001 ) and felt more `` overall '' treatment satisfaction ( p < 0.001 ) . We found no significant differences in other outcomes or adverse events . Argentine tango can improve balance , and functional mobility , and may have modest benefits upon cognition and fatigue in Parkinson 's disease . These findings must be confirmed in longer-term trials explicitly powered for cognition and fatigue .\",\n",
       " \" The aim of this preliminary clinical report was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of immediate and early loaded mini-implants ( MIs ) supporting mandibular overdentures . Thirty-six completely edentulous patients ( 20 men and 16 women ) complaining of insufficient retention of their mandibular dentures were randomly assigned to two groups . Each patient received four MIs in the interforaminal area of the mandible using the nonsubmerged flapless surgical approach . In group 1 ( G1 ) , MIs were loaded with mandibular overdentures using the immediate loading protocol , while in group 2 ( G2 ) , MIs were loaded with overdentures using the early loading protocol . The cumulative survival rate was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis . Peri-implant health indices ( Plaque Index/Bleeding Index ) , probing depths , and marginal bone levels were recorded for both groups after MI insertions and 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months thereafter . The cumulative implant survival rates were 91.7 % and 96.7 % for G1 and G2 , respectively . G1 recorded significantly higher Plaque Index , Bleeding Index , and probing depths than G2 after 12 months , while other observation times demonstrated no significant difference between groups . Most of the recorded marginal bone loss occurred in the first year , and no significant bone loss was noted in subsequent years . After 6 months , marginal bone loss was significantly higher in G1 compared to G2 , but no significant differences between groups were noted thereafter . Within the limitations of this study 's research design and duration of follow-up outcome analyses , immediate and early loading protocols showed good clinical results with favorable peri-implant tissue response 3 years after implant insertion . Early loading of MIs supporting a mandibular overdenture appears to be preferable to immediate loading .\",\n",

       " ' Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes ( BARI 2D ) was a study of management strategies for diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease . In a 22 design , early revascularization versus medical management with or without late revascularization and insulin sensitization versus insulin provision were examined . No advantage for either strategy was seen , except in the group undergoing early coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . In that group , a reduction in subsequent myocardial infarction was noted . The purpose of our report was to characterize the conduct and short-term outcomes for CABG that led to this result . Data from the BARI 2D CABG stratum were collected , including the baseline demographic and cardiovascular characteristics , technical details of the operation , and perioperative morbidity and mortality , and analyzed . A total of 347 patients were studied . The average cardiac function was normal , and most had multivessel disease . Almost all had undergone CABG by way of a median sternotomy using an internal mammary artery , and one third were off pump . The perioperative morbidity and mortality were low and compared well with larger outcomes databases . BARI 2D showed that early CABG in patients with type 2 diabetes and myocardial ischemia and multivessel disease reduced the subsequent myocardial infarction rates . The present results have demonstrated that this was achieved using off-pump surgery in certain cases , standard myocardial protection , and routine use of the internal mammary artery or other arterial grafts .',\n",

Utilizing a randomized , 4-way crossover design , cats received 0.88-1 .26 mg/kg PO q12h fOT , ORP , famotidine , and placebo ( lactose capsules ) . Intragastric pH monitoring was used to continuously record intragastric pH for 96 hours beginning on day 4 of treatment . Plasma omeprazole concentrations at steady state ( day 7 ) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with ultraviolet detection . Mean percentage time that intragastric pH was 3 and 4 were compared among groups using ANOVA with a posthoc Tukey-Kramer test ( = 0.05 ) . The mean percentage time SD that intragastric pH was 3 was 68.4 35.0 % for fOT , 73.9 23.2 % for ORP , 42.8 18.6 % for famotidine , and 16.0 14.2 % for placebo . Mean SD plasma omeprazole concentrations were similar in cats receiving fOT compared to those receiving ORP and in a range associated with acid suppression reported in other studies . These results suggest that both omeprazole formulations provide superior acid suppression in cats compared to famotidine or placebo . Fractionated enteric-coated OT is an effective acid suppressant despite disruption of the enteric coating .',\n",

In this prospective , randomized , split abdominal study , 12 consecutive patients were treated with SAL alone on 1 side and with SAL plus RFAL on the other side . Each patient had 4 ( 3 3-cm ) squares-2 per treatment type-tattooed in the lower abdominal region ( 2 on the right and 2 on the left ) . The surface area of these squares was measured with the Vectra computerized measurement system ( Canfield , Inc , Fairfield , New Jersey ) at pretreatment , at 6 weeks posttreatment , and at 1 year posttreatment . All measurements were subjected to statistical analysis using predictive analytic software and were evaluated for statistical significance . In regions treated with SAL alone , there was a 10.4 % mean skin surface area contraction at 6 weeks and 8.3 % at 1 year posttreatment . The mean skin surface area reduction was 25.8 % in regions treated with radiofrequency plus SAL at 6 weeks and at 1 year . The anatomic location of each square ( medial vs lateral ) did not statistically correlate with more or less tissue tightening . Radiofrequency-assisted tissue tightening , when applied in conjunction with SAL , is effective in achieving greater skin surface area reduction .',\n",
       " ' Inhalation therapy is the main treatment for asthma and its adequate use has been a factor responsible for disease control ; therefore , the aim of the study was to determine whether a digital media tool , which features portability on mobile phones , modifies the assimilation of the inhalation technique . A total of 66 professionals working in the health care area with the pediatric population were selected . They were submitted to a pre-test on their knowledge of inhalation therapy . The professionals were randomized into two groups ( A and B ) . Group A received a media application on their mobile phones showing the steps of inhalation therapy , while group B received the same information in written form only . A post-test was applied after 15 days . The results ( pre - and post - ) were analyzed by two pediatric pulmonologists . Of the 66 professionals , 87.9 % were females . Of a total possible score of ten , the mean score obtained in the pre-test was 5.3 3 , and in the second test , 7.5 2 ( p < 0.000 ) . There were no significant differences when comparing the two groups ( p = 0.726 ) . The nurses had the lowest mean scores in the initial test ( 2.3 2 ) ; however , they were the group that learned the most with the intervention , showing similar means to those of other groups in the second test ( 6.1 3 ) . There was significant improvement in knowledge about inhalation therapy in all professional categories using both methods , demonstrating that education , when available to professionals , positively modifies medical practice .',\n",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin , gabapentin and diclofenac on the incidence and severity of succinylcholine-induced myalgia . Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital . A total of 120 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned into three groups : Pregabalin group received 150 mg of pregabalin , gabapentin group received 600 mg of gabapentin and diclofenac group received 100 mg of diclofenac sodium orally 2 h prior to surgery . Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 3 g/kg , propofol 2-2 .5 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg and was maintained with oxygen with sevoflurane in the air and intermittent vecuronium bromide . A blinded observer recorded post-operative pain scores on visual analog scale at different time intervals and myalgia at 24 h. Post-operative pain relief was provided with fentanyl based patient-controlled analgesia . Fentanyl consumption in 24 h was recorded as a primary outcome . Patients ' characteristics and total fentanyl consumption were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc test . Pain score was compared amongst the groups using Kruskal Wallis test . The myalgia occurred in 15 , 14 and 13 patients in pregabalin , gabapentin and diclofenac sodium group respectively ( P > 0.85 ) . Patients in diclofenac group had significantly higher fentanyl consumption ( 674.85 115.58 g ) compared with pregabalin group ( 601.87 129.57 g ) ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 34.8-120 .7 ) and gabapentin group ( 612.29 105.12 g ) ( 95 % CI = 14.9-170 .5 ) .

       " ' Recently , we documented the likely non-inferiority of Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatode Artritis ( COBRA ) - light therapy ( methotrexate increased to 25mg/week with initial prednisolone 30mg/day ) compared with the original COBRA therapy ( methotrexate 7.5 mg/week , sulfasalazine 2g/day , with initial prednisolone 60mg/day ) after 26weeks in patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . To assess the non-inferiority of COBRA-light versus COBRA after 1year in terms of disease activity ( DAS44 ) , functional outcome ( Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) ) and radiographic progression ( Sharp/van der Heijde score ( SHS ) ) , and to assess the effect of adding etanercept . An open-label , randomised controlled , non-inferiority trial of 162 patients with active early RA , following a treat-to-target protocol incorporating the addition of etanercept if DAS44 1.6 at weeks 26 or 39 . Both groups showed major improvements in DAS44 after 52weeks : mean ( SD ) -2.41 ( 1.2 ) in the COBRA and -2.02 ( 1.0 ) in the COBRA-light group ( p = ns ) . In both groups , functional ability improved and radiological progression of joints was minimal . At least one adverse event was reported in 96 % of the patients in both groups . In total , 25 serious adverse events occurred : 9 vs 16 in COBRA and COBRA-light , respectively . Treatment actually instituted was often less intensive than required by the protocol : of the total population , 108 patients ( 67 % ) required etanercept ( more in the COBRA-light group ) , but only 67 of these ( 62 % ) actually received it . Intensive COBRA or COBRA-light therapy has major , comparably favourable effects on disease activity , functional ability and radiological outcome after 1year in patients with early RA . Protocolised addition of etanercept was often not implemented by treating rheumatologists , and patients receiving it appeared to have limited added benefit , probably because of low disease activity levels at its initiation .

       " ' This study compared time-to-hospitalization among subjects enrolled in different diabetes self-management programs ( DSMP ) . We sought to determine whether the interventions delayed the occurrence of any acute event necessitating hospitalization . Electronic medical records ( EMR ) were obtained for 376 adults enrolled in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) of Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) self-management programs . All study participants had uncontrolled diabetes and were randomized into either : personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , Chronic Disease Self-Management Program ( CDSMP ) , combined PDA and CDSMP ( COM ) , or usual care ( UC ) groups . Subjects were followed for a maximum of two years . Time-to-hospitalization was measured as the interval between study enrollment and the occurrence of a diabetes-related hospitalization . Subjects enrolled in the CDSMP-only arm had significantly prolonged time-to-hospitalization ( Hazard ratio : 0.10 ; p = 0.002 ) when compared to subjects in the control arm . Subjects in the PDA-only and combined PDA and CDSMP arms showed no improvements in comparison to the control arm . CDSMP can be effective in delaying time-to-hospitalization among patients with T2DM . Reducing unnecessary healthcare utilization , particularly inpatient hospitalization is a key strategy to improving the quality of health care and lowering associated health care costs . The CDSMP offers the potential to reduce time-to-hospitalization among T2DM patients .',\n",
       " \" The benefit of CT coronary angiography ( CTCA ) in patients presenting with stable chest pain has not been systematically studied . We aimed to assess the effect of CTCA on the diagnosis , management , and outcome of patients referred to the cardiology clinic with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease . In this prospective open-label , parallel-group , multicentre trial , we recruited patients aged 18-75 years referred for the assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease from 12 cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland . We randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) participants to standard care plus CTCA or standard care alone . Randomisation was done with a web-based service to ensure allocation concealment . The primary endpoint was certainty of the diagnosis of angina secondary to coronary heart disease at 6 weeks . All analyses were intention to treat , and patients were analysed in the group they were allocated to , irrespective of compliance with scanning . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01149590 . Between Nov 18 , 2010 , and Sept 24 , 2014 , we randomly assigned 4146 ( 42 % ) of 9849 patients who had been referred for assessment of suspected angina due to coronary heart disease . 47 % of participants had a baseline clinic diagnosis of coronary heart disease and 36 % had angina due to coronary heart disease . At 6 weeks , CTCA reclassified the diagnosis of coronary heart disease in 558 ( 27 % ) patients and the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease in 481 ( 23 % ) patients ( standard care 22 [ 1 % ] and 23 [ 1 % ] ; p < 00001 ) . Although both the certainty ( relative risk [ RR ] 256 , 95 % CI 233-279 ; p < 00001 ) and frequency of coronary heart disease increased ( 109 , 102-117 ; p = 00172 ) , the certainty increased ( 179 , 162-196 ; p < 00001 ) and frequency seemed to decrease ( 093 , 085-102 ; p = 01289 ) for the diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease . This changed planned investigations ( 15 % vs 1 % ; p < 00001 ) and treatments ( 23 % vs 5 % ; p < 00001 ) but did not affect 6-week symptom severity or subsequent admittances to hospital for chest pain . After 17 years , CTCA was associated with a 38 % reduction in fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction ( 26 vs 42 , HR 062 , 95 % CI 038-101 ; p = 00527 ) , but this was not significant . In patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease , CTCA clarifies the diagnosis , enables targeting of interventions , and might reduce the future risk of myocardial infarction .

       " \" To evaluate the effect of different polymerization sequences employed during application of bis-GMAbased particulate filler composites ( PFC ) or a flowable resin ( FR ) on fiber-reinforced composite ( FRC ) . Unidirectional , pre-impregnated S2-glass fibers ( Dentapreg ) and multidirectional preimpregnated E-glass fibers ( Dentapreg ) ( length : 40 mm ; thickness : 0.5 mm ) were obtained ( N = 144 , n = 12 per group ) and embedded in translucent silicone material with the adhesion surface exposed . The resulting specimens were randomly divided into 12 groups for the following application sequences : a ) FRC+PFC ( photopolymerized in one step ) , b ) FRC+FR ( photopolymerized in one step ) , c ) FRC+PFC ( photopolymerized individually ) , d ) FRC+FR ( photopolymerized individually ) , e ) FRC ( photopolymerized ) + intermediate adhesive resin and PFC ( photopolymerized in one step ) , f ) FRC ( photopolymerized ) + intermediate adhesive resin and FR ( photopolymerized in one step ) . The sequences of unidirectional ( groups a to f ) were repeated for multidirectional ( groups g to l ) FRCs . PFCs were debonded from the FRC surfaces using the shear bond test in a universal testing machine ( 1 mm/min ) . On additional specimens from each FRC type , thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) was performed to characterize the fiber weight content ( Wf ) ( N = 6 , n = 3 per group ) . After debonding , all specimens were analyzed using SEM to categorize the failure modes . The data were statistically analyzed using 3-way ANOVA and Tukey 's tests ( = 0.05 ) . Significant effects of the FRC type ( S2 or E-glass ) ( p < 0.01 ) , resin type ( PFC or FR ) ( p < 0.01 ) and polymerization protocol ( p < 0.05 ) were observed on the bond strength ( MPa ) . Interaction terms were also significant ( p < 0.05 ) . The multidirectional FRC groups ( g to l ) showed significantly lower bond strengths ( 2.3 0.2 to 7.3 0.3 MPa ) than did the unidirectional FRC groups ( a to f ) ( 10.7 0.6 to 24.4 0.8 MPa ) . Among the unidirectional FRC groups , the highest values were obtained with protocol f ( 24.4 0.8 ) , followed by protocol e ( 18.6 0.4 ) . PFC adhesion to unidirectional FRC was lower when FRC and PFC were polymerized in one step ( protocol a : 11.3 0.5 ) than individual polymerization ( protocol c : 14.1 0.5 ) . The opposite situation was true for FR ( protocol b : 17.5 0.4 ; protocol d : 10.7 0.6 ) . Groups a to f presented exclusively mixed failures ( a combination of partial cohesive failure in the PFC and adhesive failure between the FRC and PFC ) and groups g to l demonstrated only adhesive failure ( intact FRC no cohesive failure of PFC ) . TGA revealed 55 3 wt % fiber content for multidirectional and 60 3 wt % for unidirectional FRCs tested . Multidirectional pre-impregnated E-glass fibers can not be recommended in combination with the PFC and FR materials tested in this study . Application of an intermediate adhesive resin layer increases the adhesion of both PFC and FR to unidirectional FRC . FRC and FR can be polymerized in one step , but FRC and PFC combinations should be polymerized individually .\",\n",
       " ' Medium chain triglycerides ( MCT ) enhance thermogenesis and may reduce food intake relative to long chain triglycerides ( LCT ) . The goal of this study was to establish the effects of MCT on appetite and food intake and determine whether differences were due to differences in hormone concentrations . Two randomized , crossover studies were conducted in which overweight men consumed 20g of MCT or corn oil ( LCT ) at breakfast . Blood samples were obtained over 3h . In Study 1 ( n = 10 ) , an ad lib lunch was served after 3h . In Study 2 ( n = 7 ) , a preload containing 10g of test oil was given at 3h and lunch was served 1h later . Linear mixed model analyses were performed to determine the effects of MCT and LCT oil on change in hormones and metabolites from fasting , adjusting for body weight . Correlations were computed between differences in hormones just before the test meals and differences in intakes after the two oils for Study 1 only . Food intake at the lunch test meal after the MCT preload ( Study 2 ) was ( means.e.m . ) 532389kcal vs 804486kcal after LCT ( P < 0.05 ) . MCT consumption resulted in a lower rise in triglycerides ( P = 0.014 ) and glucose ( P = 0.066 ) and a higher rise in peptide YY ( PYY , P = 0.017 ) and leptin ( P = 0.036 ) compared with LCT ( combined data ) . Correlations between differences in hormone levels ( glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-1 ) , PYY ) and differences in food intake were in the opposite direction to expectations . MCT consumption reduced food intake acutely but this does not seem to be mediated by changes in GLP-1 , PYY and insulin .',\n",
       " ' High-risk prescribing in primary care is common and causes considerable harm . Feedback interventions have small/moderate effects on clinical practice , but few trials explicitly compare different forms of feedback . There is growing recognition that intervention development should be theory-informed , and that comprehensive reporting of intervention design is required by potential users of trial findings . The paper describes intervention development for the Effective Feedback to Improve Primary Care Prescribing Safety ( EFIPPS ) study , a pragmatic three-arm cluster randomised trial in 262 Scottish general practices . The NHS chose to implement a feedback intervention to utilise a new resource , new Prescribing Information System ( newPIS ) . The development phase required selection of high-risk prescribing outcome measures and design of intervention components : ( 1 ) educational material ( the usual care comparison ) , ( 2 ) feedback of practice rates of high-risk prescribing received by both intervention arms and ( 3 ) a theory-informed behaviour change component to be received by one intervention arm . Outcome measures , educational material and feedback design , were developed with a National Health Service Advisory Group . The behaviour change component was informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Health Action Process Approach . A focus group elicitation study and an email Delphi study with general practitioners ( GPs ) identified key attitudes and barriers of responding to the prescribing feedback . Behaviour change techniques were mapped to the psychological constructs , and the content was informed by the results of the elicitation and Delphi study . Six high-risk prescribing measures were selected in a consensus process based on importance and feasibility . Educational material and feedback design were based on current NHS Scotland practice and Advisory Group recommendations . The behaviour change component was resource constrained in development , mirroring what is feasible in an NHS context . Four behaviour change interventions were developed and embedded in five quarterly rounds of feedback targeting attitudes , subjective norms , perceived behavioural control and action planning ( 2 ) . The paper describes a process which is feasible to use in the resource-constrained environment of NHS-led intervention development and documents the intervention to make its design and implementation explicit to potential users of the trial findings .

       " ' Infusion of PDA-001 , a preparation of mesenchymal-like cells derived from full-term human placenta , is a new approach in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis . This safety study aimed to rule out the possibility of paradoxical exacerbation of disease activity by PDA-001 in patients with multiple sclerosis . This was a phase 1b , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-dose ranging study including patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis . The study was conducted at 6 sites in the United States and 2 sites in Canada . Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive 2 low-dose infusions of PDA-001 ( 15010 ( 6 ) cells ) or placebo , given 1 week apart . After completing this cohort , subsequent patients received high-dose PDA-001 ( 60010 ( 6 ) cells ) or placebo . Monthly brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed . The primary end point was ruling out the possibility of paradoxical worsening of MS disease activity . This was monitored using Cutters rule ( 5 new gadolinium lesions on 2 consecutive scans ) by brain magnetic resonance imaging on a monthly basis for six months and also the frequency of multiple sclerosis relapse . Ten patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 6 with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned to treatment : 6 to low-dose PDA-001 , 6 to high-dose PDA-001 , and 4 to placebo . No patient met Cutters rule . One patient receiving high-dose PDA-001 had an increase in T2 and gadolinium lesions and in Expanded Disability Status Scale score during a multiple sclerosis flare 5 months after receiving PDA-001 . No other patient had an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale score > 0.5 , and most had stable or decreasing Expanded Disability Status Scale scores . With high-dose PDA-001 , 1 patient experienced a grade 1 anaphylactoid reaction and 1 had grade 2 superficial thrombophlebitis . Other adverse events were mild to moderate and included headache , fatigue , infusion site reactions , and urinary tract infection . PDA-001 infusions were safe and well tolerated in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients .

The NDP group received NDP 80-100 mg/m iv on day 1 + leucovorin ( CF ) 100 mg/m iv on days 1-5 + 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) 500 mg/m iv on days 1-5 . The DDP group received DDP 30 mg/m iv on days 1-3 + CF 100 mg/m on days 1-5 + 5-FU 500 mg/m iv on days 1-5 . The treatment was repeated every 4 wk in both groups . Concurrent radiotherapy [ 60-66 Gy / ( 30-33 f ) / ( 6-7 wk ) ] was given during chemotherapy . There was no significant difference in the short-term response rate between the NDP group and DDP group ( 90.9 % vs 81.3 % , P = 0.528 ) . Although the 1 - and 2-year survival rates were higher in the NDP group than in the DDP group ( 75.8 % vs 68.8 % , 57.6 % vs 50.0 % ) , the difference in the overall survival rate was not statistically significant between the two groups ( P = 0.540 ) . The incidences of nausea , vomiting and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower in the NDP group than in the DDP group ( 17.6 % vs 50.0 % , P = 0.031 ; 11.8 % vs 47.1 % , P = 0.016 ; 8.8 % vs 38.2 % , P = 0.039 ) .

Oxytocin-treated participants reported stronger positive attitudes toward themselves compared to placebo . The present findings demonstrate that oxytocin administration influences the early stage of self-related information processing and suggests that the oxytocinergic system might be involved in psychopathological conditions characterized by a negative representation of self .',\n",
       " ' Nonarteriitic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy ( NAION ) is a leading cause of sudden loss of vision , which particularly affects individuals older than 50 years . Up to now there is no treatment that is effective at reversing or limiting the course of this disease . To study the short - and long-term effects of fluocortolone ( FC ) on the visual outcome of patients with acute NAION compared to standard treatment with pentoxifylline ( PFX ) . A prospective , quasirandomized intervention trial was conducted involving 60 patients with acute-onset NAION . Patients in the comparison ( PFX ) group ( n = 30 ) received PFX intravenously and per os for 7 days and then per os for a further 6 months , which is a standard treatment . Patients in the intervention ( PFX + FC ) group ( n = 30 ) received the standard treatment plus 1 mg/kg FC for 5 days , with a subsequent stepwise dose reduction over time . As a primary outcome measure , the best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) was determined at the initial baseline consultation ( i.e. , before treatment ) , and at 3 days and 6 months after therapy onset . Visual field ( VF ) was analyzed using standard automated perimetry at the initial baseline examination and at 6 month after therapy onset . Changes in BCVA and visual field in the PFX and PFX + FC groups were compared and analyzed statistically . Treatment with FC resulted in a significant improvement in BCVA . Patients receiving FC in acute NAION were more likely to experience improvement and less likely to have worsened visual acuity ( mean BCVA scores : at baseline , 0.22 ; after 3 days and 6 months of treatment , 0.33 and 0.43 , respectively ) than PFX patients ( mean BCVA scores : at baseline , 0.33 ; after 3 days and 6 months of treatment , 0.33 and 0.28 , respectively ; p < 0.002 and 0.001 ) . The beneficial effect was even more marked 6 months after therapy onset . Remarkably , patients with a baseline BCVA score of > = 0.05 profited significantly by FC treatment ( p < 0.006 and 0.001 ) , whereas those with a baseline BCVA score of < 0.05 did not ( p < 0.4 ) . PFX did not improve BCVA . However , VF did not show any significant improvement due to FC therapy . This is the first prospective randomized intervention trial that demonstrates the distinctive beneficial effects of FC in terms of the visual outcome of patients with NAION compared to standard treatment with only PFX . FC significantly improves both short - and long-term visual acuity in patients with moderate BCVA impairment due to recent onset of NAION , while VF did not show any significant improvement ; however , PFX did neither enhance BCVA nor VF . Administration of FC should be seriously considered for the treatment of NAION whenever there are no contraindications .',\n",

This study assesses whether the feeding of a galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) - containing infant formula ( 0.44 g/dl of GOS ) and the subsequent feeding of a GOS-containing follow-on formula ( 0.50 g/dl of GOS ) have a prebiotic effect on intestinal microbiota that helps to decrease infections and allergy manifestations in healthy infants during the first year of life . A multicentre , randomised , double-blind and placebo-controlled trial was carried out on 365 healthy term infants enrolled before 8 weeks of age and randomly assigned to a formula with or without GOS , until 12 months of age . The incidence of infections and allergy manifestations , the antibiotics prescribed and faecal characteristics were recorded up to 12 months of age , while faecal samples were collected up to 4 months for the measurement of secretory immunoglobulin A , short-chain fatty acids and microbiota . A prebiotic effect on the faecal analysis was observed at 4 months of life . The GOS group showed a lower faecal pH ( P = 0.019 ) , a lower decreasing trend in secretory immunoglobulin A ( P = 0.078 ) , lower butyric acid concentration ( P = 0.040 ) and an increase in Bifidobacterium counts ( P = 0.010 ) . Changes in faecal characteristics involved greater frequency ( P < 0.001 ) and softer consistency ( P < 0.05 ) . The incidence of infections or allergic manifestations during the first year of life was similar in both groups , with no statistical differences ( P > 0.05 ) . The feeding of GOS-containing infant formula produced a definite prebiotic effect consisting of changes in faecal composition and microbiota , and in faecal consistency and the frequency of defaecation . No changes in the incidence of infection or allergic manifestation during the first year of life were observed .',\n",

Inclusion criteria were at least one of the followings : waist circumference ( 90 cm for males and 84 cm for females ) , and at least one other criterion : triglycerides 1.7 mmol/L , high density lipoprotein cholesterol < 1 mmol/L ( males ) or < 1.3 mmol/L ( females ) , blood pressure 130 mmHg ( systolic ) and/or 85 mmHg ( diastolic ) , and glucose 5.5 mmol/L . Weight-maintaining diets that included shakes with one of the dietary oil blends were provided during each of the five 30-day dietary phases . Dietary phases were separated by four-week washout periods . Treatment oils were canola oil , high oleic canola oil , high oleic canola oil enriched with docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , flax oil and safflower oil blend , and corn oil and safflower oil blend . A per protocol approach with a mixed model analysis was decided to be appropriate for data analysis . One hundred and seventy volunteers were randomized and 130 completed the study with a dropout rate of 23.5 % . The mean plasma total DHA concentrations , which were analyzed among all participants as a measure of adherence , increased by more than 100 % in the DHA-enriched phase , compared to other phases , demonstrating excellent dietary adherence . Recruitment and retention strategies were effective in achieving a sufficient number of participants who completed the study protocol to enable sufficient statistical power to resolve small differences in outcome measures . It is expected that the study will generate important data thereby enhancing our understanding of the effects of n-3 , n-6 , and n-9 fatty acid-containing oils on CVD risks .

       " ' UK cancer guidelines recommend patients with colonic obstruction due to suspected malignancy be considered for stenting with a self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) . Considerable variation in practice exists due to a lack of expertise , technical difficulties and other , as yet ill-defined features . This retrospective multi-centre study aims to determine the outcome following colonic stenting for large bowel obstruction and identify factors associated with successful intervention . A regional programme of colonic stenting for large bowel obstruction , in five UK centres from 2005 to 2010 was evaluated for outcome including technical and clinical success , survival , complications and reoperation . A SEMS was inserted in 334 patients , including 264 ( 79.0 % ) for palliation and 52 ( 15.6 % ) as a bridge to surgery . Technical success was achieved in 292 ( 87.4 % ) patients , with 46 ( 13.8 % ) experiencing a complication or technical failure . Reoperation was required in 39 ( 14.8 % ) patients stented for palliation of colorectal cancer of whom 16 ( 6.1 % ) subsequently required a colostomy . A one-stage primary anastomosis was achieved in 35 ( 67.3 % ) of the 52 patients undergoing stenting as a bridge to resection . Technical success did not vary by indication or site of obstruction ( P = 0.60 ) but was higher for operators who had performed more than 10 procedures ( OR 3.34 , P = 0.001 ) . ASA grade 3 predicted a worse clinical outcome ( OR 0.43 , P = 0.04 ) . The through-the-scope ( TTS ) endoscopy technique was more successful than radiological placement alone ( 90.3 % vs 74.8 % , P < 0.001 ) . Experienced operators using a TTS technique achieved a better outcome for the emergency management of large bowel obstruction . Older , sicker patients and those with extracolonic and benign strictures fared less well .',\n",
       " ' The guided outcomes in learned efficiency ( GOLE ) model emphasizes the use of evidence-based resources to understand the diagnosis , treatment , follow-up , and prevention of disease . We seek to determine whether presentations created using the GOLE model are superior to an unstructured approach in achieving Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) Core Competencies . Consenting medical students were randomized to GOLE or control groups to individually research a self-selected clinical topic . A validated survey instrument was used prepresentation and postpresentation to assess perceived improvement in knowledge . Subjects completed self-evaluations at enrollment and after presentation of their chosen clinical topic . Other students , residents , and a faculty member also completed evaluations after each student presentation . Standard statistical methods ( analysis of variance , 2-tailed t test ) were used to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between intervention and control groups . Self-assessments were similar in the GOLE and control groups . Externally perceived presentation scores were greater in the GOLE group ( ACGME global P < .0001 , presentation global P = .07 ) , which demonstrated a significant improvement in 5 core competencies . Time spent preparing the presentation and resources utilized did not differ between groups . The presentations prepared using the GOLE model were rated higher by observers than those prepared using traditional techniques .',\n",
       " \" The neighborhoods in which children live , play , and eat provide an environmental context that may influence obesity risk and ameliorate or exacerbate health disparities . The current study examines whether neighborhood characteristics predict obesity in a prospective cohort of girls . Participants were 174 girls ( aged 8-10 years at baseline ) , a subset from the Cohort Study of Young Girls ' Nutrition , Environment , and Transitions . Trained observers completed street audits within a 0.25-mile radius around each girl 's residence . Four scales ( food and service retail , recreation , walkability , and physical disorder ) were created from 40 observed neighborhood features . BMI was calculated from clinically measured height and weight . Obesity was defined as BMI-for-age 95 % . Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to examine neighborhood influences on obesity risk over 4 years of follow-up , controlling for race/ethnicity , pubertal status , and baseline BMI . Fully adjusted models also controlled for household income , parent education , and a census tract measure of neighborhood socioeconomic status . A 1-SD increase on the food and service retail scale was associated with a 2.27 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.42 to 3.61 ; P < .001 ) increased odds of being obese . A 1-SD increase in physical disorder was associated with a 2.41 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.31 to 4.44 ; P = .005 ) increased odds of being obese . Other neighborhood scales were not associated with risk for obesity . Neighborhood food and retail environment and physical disorder around a girl 's home predict risk for obesity across the transition from late childhood to adolescence .\",\n",
       " ' Cervical total disc replacement ( CTDR ) was developed to treat cervical spondylosis , while preserving motion . While anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) has been the standard of care for 2-level disease , a randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) suggested similar outcomes . Cost-effectiveness of this intervention has never been elucidated . To determine the cost-effectiveness of CTDR compared with ACDF . Data were derived from an RCT that followed up 330 patients over 24 months . The original RCT consisted of multi-institutional data including private and academic institutions . Using linear regression for the current study , health states were constructed based on the stratification of the Neck Disability Index and a visual analog scale . Data from the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaires were transformed into utilities values using the SF-6D mapping algorithm . Costs were calculated by extracting Diagnosis-Related Group codes from institutional billing data and then applying 2012 Medicare reimbursement rates . The costs of complications and return-to-work data were also calculated . A Markov model was built to evaluate quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) for both treatment groups . The model adopted a third-party payer perspective and applied a 3 % annual discount rate . Patients included in the original RCT had to be diagnosed as having radiculopathy or myeloradiculopathy at 2 contiguous levels from C3-C7 that was unresponsive to conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks or demonstrated progressive symptoms . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CTDR compared with ACDF . A strong correlation ( R2 = 0.6864 ; P < .001 ) was found by projecting a visual analog scale onto the Neck Disability Index . Cervical total disc replacement had an average of 1.58 QALYs after 24 months compared with 1.50 QALYs for ACDF recipients . Cervical total disc replacement was associated with $ 2139 greater average cost . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CTDR compared with ACDF was $ 24,594 per QALY at 2 years . Despite varying input parameters in the sensitivity analysis , the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio value stays below the threshold of $ 50,000 per QALY in most scenarios ( range , - $ 58,194 to $ 147,862 per QALY ) . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CTDR compared with traditional ACDF is lower than the commonly accepted threshold of $ 50,000 per QALY . This remains true with varying input parameters in a robust sensitivity analysis , reaffirming the stability of the model and the sustainability of this intervention .',\n",

This was a randomised trial in 155 patients with non-diabetic CKD comparing aliskiren ( 150 mg/day ) ( n = 52 ) versus losartan ( 100 mg/day ) ( n = 52 ) and the third group aliskiren ( 150 mg/day ) combined with losartan ( 100 mg/day ) ( n = 51 ) . The trial utilised primary renal end points of eGFR < 15 ml/min or end-stage renal failure . All three groups had significant reduction of proteinuria ( p < 0.001 for all ) . The changes in eGFR , total urinary protein from baseline to each year were not significantly different between the three therapeutic groups . This study in non-diabetic CKD patients showed that combination therapy with aliskiren and ARB was as efficacious as aliskiren alone and ARB alone . There was one patient who developed a non-fatal stroke in the combined aliskiren and ARB group while the other two groups had none .',\n",
       " ' Very low density lipoprotein triglyceride ( VLDL-TG ) and free fatty acids ( FFA ) constitute a substantial proportion of human energy supply both at rest and during exercise . Exercise acutely decreases VLDL-TG concentration , and VLDL-TG clearance is increased after an exercise bout . However , the effects of long-term training are not clear . The aim was to investigate long-term effects of training by direct assessments of VLDL-TG and palmitate kinetics and oxidation in healthy lean men ( n = 9 ) at rest , before and after a 10-week training program , compared with a non-training control group ( n = 9 ) . VLDL-TG kinetics were assessed by a primed constant infusion of [ 1-14C ] VLDL-TG , and VLDL-TG oxidation by specific activity ( 14CO2 ) in expired air . The metabolic study days were placed 60-72h after the last exercise bout . Palmitate kinetics and oxidation were assessed by a 2h constant infusion of [ 9,10 - ( 3 ) H ] palmitate . In the training group ( n = 9 ) , maximal oxygen uptake increased significantly by 20 % ( P < 0.05 ) , and the insulin sensitivity ( assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ) improved significantly ( P < 0.05 ) . Despite these metabolic improvements , no changes were observed in VLDL-TG secretion , clearance , or oxidation or in palmitate kinetics . We conclude that 10 weeks of exercise training did not induce changes in VLDL-TG and palmitate kinetics in healthy lean men .',\n",

Forty children with hematological tumors were randomly divided into SFT and control groups ( n = 20 each ) . The control group received conventional chemotherapy . The SFT group received SFT by a trained therapist in addition to conventional chemotherapy ; the family of each patient received SFT four times ( once every two weeks ) . Both groups were assessed by the Family Assessment Device ( FAD ) and Family Environment Scale-Chinese Version ( FES-CV ) on admission and one month after the end of SFT . After treatment , the SFT group showed significant decreases in all factor scores of FAD ( P < 0.05 ) ; the SFT group had significantly lower scores of problem solving , communication , roles , affective involvement , behavior control , and general functioning than the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . In addition , the SFT group had significantly increased FES-CV scores of cohesion , emotional expression , intellectual-cultural orientation , and active-recreational orientation and a significantly decreased score of conflict after treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , and the SFT group was significantly superior to the control group in terms of these items ( P < 0.05 ) . SFT could promote beneficial family changes in children with hematological tumors by improving the family function and internal environment , which would increase the long-term chemotherapy compliance of these children and their parents .',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study was to assess pain associated with subcutaneous injection into the abdomen and thigh of different combinations of injection speeds and volumes . The study was a single-centre , one-visit , double-blinded , randomized controlled trial in 82 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes receiving daily injections of insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) agonists . Participants received 17 subcutaneous injections ( 12 in abdomen , 5 in thigh ) of saline at different injection speeds ( 150 , 300 and 450 l/s ) , with different volumes ( 400 , 800 , 1200 and 1600 l ) , and two needle insertions without any injection . Pain was evaluated on a 100-mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ( 0 mm no pain , 100 mm worst pain ) and on a yes/no scale for pain acceptability . Injection speed had no impact on injection pain ( p = 0.833 ) . Injection of larger volumes caused significantly more pain [ VAS least square mean differences 1600 vs. 400 l , 7 2 mm ( 95 % confidence interval - CI ; 4.6-9 .7 ; p < 0.0001 ) ; 1600 vs. 800 l , 7.2 mm ( 4.4-10 .0 ; p < 0.0001 ) ; 1200 vs. 400 l , 3.5 mm ( 0.4-6 .6 ; p = 0.025 ) and 1200 vs. 800 l , 3.6 mm ( 0.4-6 .7 ; p = 0.027 ) ] . Significantly more pain occurred in the thigh versus the abdomen [ 9.0 mm ( 6.7-11 .3 ; p < 0.0001 ) ] . Injection speed had no effect on injection pain , whereas higher injection volumes caused more pain . The results of this study may be of value for guiding patients to use the appropriate injection site and technique to reduce their injection pain . Furthermore , these findings may have important implications for the development of new injection devices and drug formulations for clinical practice .',\n",

Current antibiotic prophylaxis for vascular procedures includes a first generation cephalosporin . No changes in recommendations have occurred despite changes in reports of incidence of MRSA related surgical site infections . Does supplemental anti-MRSA prophylactic coverage provide a significant reduction in Gram-positive or MRSA infections ? Single center prospective double blinded randomized study of patients undergoing lower extremity vascular procedures from 2011 to 2014 . One hundred seventy-eight ( 178 ) patients were evaluated at 90 days for surgical site infection . Infections were categorized as early infections less than 30 days of the index procedure and late after 90 days . Early vascular surgical site infection occurred in 7 ( 8.24 % ) of patients in the Vancomycin arm , and 11 ( 11.83 % ) in the Daptomycin arm ( P = 0.43 ) . Gram-positive related infections and MRSA infections occurred in 1 ( 1.18 % ) / 0 ( 0 % ) of Vancomycin patients and 9 ( 9.68 % ) / 1 ( 1.08 % ) of Daptomycin patients , respectively ( P < 0.02 and P = 1.00 ) .

Tumour samples were retrospectively obtained from 229 patients from a prospective randomised phase III trial of the AIO colorectal study group , comparing CAPOX and FUFOX in mCRC . Immunohistochemistry of p53 and MMR proteins as well as microsatellite analysis were performed . The incidence of MSI-H and p53 overexpression was 7.9 % and 65.4 % , respectively . MSI-H status was not correlated with ORR , PFS and OS . We observed a trend to lower DCR for MSI-H tumours ( 65 % vs. 85 % , p = 0.055 ) . p53 overexpression was not correlated with DCR , ORR and PFS . The median OS of patients with tumors with p53 overexpression was significantly longer compared to tumors withhout p53 overexpression ( 19.6 vs. 15.8 months ; p = 0.05 ) . The post-progression survival ( PPS ) of p53-positive patients undergoing 2nd and/or 3rd line chemotherapy with irinotecan and/or cetuximab was significantly longer compared to p53-negative patients . MSI-H tumours tend to have lower disease control rates when treated with an oxaliplatin/fluoropyrmidin combination . mCRC patients with p53 overexpression undergoing an irinotecan containing second - or third-line chemotherapy after oxaliplatin failure have a significantly longer post-progression survival compared to patients without p53 overexpression .

       " ' The ability of polymer-modified coils to promote stable aneurysm occlusion after endovascular treatment is not well-documented . Angiographic aneurysm recurrence is widely used as a surrogate for treatment failure , but studies documenting the correlation of angiographic recurrence with clinical failure are limited . This trial compares the effectiveness of Matrix ( 2 ) polyglycolic/polylactic acid biopolymer-modified coils with bare metal coils and correlates the angiographic findings with clinical failure ( ie , target aneurysm recurrence ) , a composite end point that includes any incident of posttreatment aneurysm rupture , retreatment , or unexplained death . This was a multicenter randomized noninferiority trial with blinded end point adjudication . We enrolled 626 patients , divided between Matrix ( 2 ) and bare metal coil groups . The primary outcome was target aneurysm recurrence at 12 3 months . At 455 days , at least 1 target aneurysm recurrence event had occurred in 14.6 % of patients treated with bare metal coils and 13.3 % of Matrix ( 2 ) ( P = .76 , log-rank test ) patients ; 92.8 % of target aneurysm recurrence events were re-interventions for aneurysms that had not bled after treatment , and 5.8 % of target aneurysm recurrence events resulted from hemorrhage or rehemorrhage , with or without retreatment . Symptomatic re-intervention occurred in only 4 ( 0.6 % ) patients . At 455 days , 95.8 % of patients with unruptured aneurysms and 90.4 % of those with ruptured aneurysms were independent ( mRS 2 ) . Target aneurysm recurrence was associated with incomplete initial angiographic aneurysm obliteration , presentation with rupture , and a larger aneurysmal dome and neck size . Tested Matrix ( 2 ) coils were not inferior to bare metal coils . Endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms was safe , and the rate of technical success was high . Target aneurysm recurrence is a promising clinical outcome measure that correlates well with established angiographic measurements .',\n",

       " ' The stepped care program Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology ( BRIA ) aims at motivating and supporting surgical patients with comorbid mental disorders to engage in psychosocial mental healthcare options . This study examined the efficacy of BRIA . This randomized , parallel-group , open-label , controlled trial was conducted in the preoperative anesthesiological assessment clinics and surgical wards of a large university hospital in Germany . A total of 220 surgical patients with comorbid mental disorders were randomized by using the computer-generated lists to one of two intervention groups : BRIA psychotherapy sessions up to 3 months postoperatively ( BRIA ) versus no psychotherapy/computerized brief written advice ( BWA ) only . Primary outcome was participation in psychosocial mental healthcare options at month 6 . Secondary outcome was change of self-reported general psychological distress ( Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory ) between baseline and month 6 . At 6-month follow-up , the rate of patients who engaged in psychosocial mental healthcare options was 30 % ( 33 of 110 ) in BRIA compared with 11.8 % ( 13 of 110 ) in BWA ( P = 0.001 ) . Number needed to treat and relative risk reduction were 6 ( 95 % CI , 4 to 13 ) and 0.21 ( 0.09 to 0.31 ) , respectively . In BRIA , Global Severity Index decreased between baseline and month 6 ( P < 0.001 ) , whereas it did not change significantly in BWA ( P = 0.197 ) . Among surgical patients with comorbid mental disorders , BRIA results in an increased engagement in subsequent therapy options and a decrease of general psychological distress . These data suggest that it is reasonable to integrate innovative psychotherapy programs into the context of interdisciplinary surgical care .',\n",

Moreover the relationship among sleep , daily functioning , HRV , vitamin D status , and levels of EPA+DHA was investigated . Ninety-five male forensic patients from a secure forensic inpatient facility in the USA were randomly assigned into a Fish or a Control group . The Fish group received Atlantic salmon three times per week from September to February , and the Control group was provided an alternative meal ( e.g. , chicken , pork , beef ) , but with the same nutritional value as their habitual diet , three times per week during the same period . Sleep ( sleep latency , sleep efficiency , actual sleep time , and actual wake time ) , self-perceived sleep quality and daily functioning , as well as vitamin D status , EPA+DHA , and HRV , were assessed pre - and post-intervention period . There was a significant increase in sleep latency from pre - to post-test in the Control group . The Fish group reported better daily functioning than the Control group during post-test . Fish consumption throughout the wintertime had also an effect on resting HRV and EPA+DHA , but not on vitamin D status . However , at post-test , the vitamin D status in the Fish group was still closer to the level regarded as optimal compared to the Control group . Vitamin D status correlated negatively with actual wake time and positively with sleep efficiency during pre-test , as well as positively with daily functioning and sleep quality during post-test . Finally , HRV correlated negatively with sleep latency and positively with daily functioning . Fish consumption seemed to have a positive impact on sleep in general and also on daily functioning , which may be related to vitamin D status and HRV .',\n",

Additional analyses compared days 1-10 , 11-21 , 22-32 , 33-42 , 43-60 , and 61-180 . Thirty-two individuals were randomized into each study arm ; two did not complete follow-up . From days 11 to 42 , 59 partial and 6 generalized seizure days occurred in 20 individuals , nonsignificantly fewer in the enhanced arm ( 12 vs. 49 , p = 0.114 ) . The numbers of patients with seizures in this period showed similar nonsignificant differences . In the enhanced steroid arm there were significantly fewer days and individuals with seizures during antiparasitic treatment ( days 1-10 : 4 vs. 17 , p = 0.004 , and 1 vs. 10 , p = 0.003 , number needed to treat [ NNT ] 4.6 , relative risk [ RR ] 0.1013 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.01-0 .74 ) and early after dexamethasone cessation ( days 11-21 : 6 vs. 27 , p = 0.014 , and 4 vs. 12 , p = 0.021 , NNT 4.0 , RR 0.33 , 95 % CI 0.12-0 .92 ) but not after day 21 . There were no significant differences in antiparasitic efficacy or relevant adverse events . Increased dexamethasone dosing results in fewer seizures for the first 21 days during and early after antiparasitic treatment for viable parenchymal NCC but not during the first 11-42 days , which was the primary predetermined time of analysis .\",\n",
       " ' A strategy using mechanical chest compressions might improve the poor outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , but such a strategy has not been tested in large clinical trials . To determine whether administering mechanical chest compressions with defibrillation during ongoing compressions ( mechanical CPR ) , compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( manual CPR ) , according to guidelines , would improve 4-hour survival . Multicenter randomized clinical trial of 2589 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest conducted between January 2008 and February 2013 in 4 Swedish , 1 British , and 1 Dutch ambulance services and their referring hospitals . Duration of follow-up was 6 months . Patients were randomized to receive either mechanical chest compressions ( LUCAS Chest Compression System , Physio-Control/Jolife AB ) combined with defibrillation during ongoing compressions ( n = 1300 ) or to manual CPR according to guidelines ( n = 1289 ) . Four-hour survival , with secondary end points of survival up to 6 months with good neurological outcome using the Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) score . A CPC score of 1 or 2 was classified as a good outcome . Four-hour survival was achieved in 307 patients ( 23.6 % ) with mechanical CPR and 305 ( 23.7 % ) with manual CPR ( risk difference , -0.05 % ; 95 % CI , -3.3 % to 3.2 % ; P > .99 ) . Survival with a CPC score of 1 or 2 occurred in 98 ( 7.5 % ) vs 82 ( 6.4 % ) ( risk difference , 1.18 % ; 95 % CI , -0.78 % to 3.1 % ) at intensive care unit discharge , in 108 ( 8.3 % ) vs 100 ( 7.8 % ) ( risk difference , 0.55 % ; 95 % CI , -1.5 % to 2.6 % ) at hospital discharge , in 105 ( 8.1 % ) vs 94 ( 7.3 % ) ( risk difference , 0.78 % ; 95 % CI , -1.3 % to 2.8 % ) at 1 month , and in 110 ( 8.5 % ) vs 98 ( 7.6 % ) ( risk difference , 0.86 % ; 95 % CI , -1.2 % to 3.0 % ) at 6 months with mechanical CPR and manual CPR , respectively . Among patients surviving at 6 months , 99 % in the mechanical CPR group and 94 % in the manual CPR group had CPC scores of 1 or 2 . Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , there was no significant difference in 4-hour survival between patients treated with the mechanical CPR algorithm or those treated with guideline-adherent manual CPR . The vast majority of survivors in both groups had good neurological outcomes by 6 months . In clinical practice , mechanical CPR using the presented algorithm did not result in improved effectiveness compared with manual CPR . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00609778 .',\n",

Although no neuroprotective treatments for PD have been found to date , the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a promising target . From a sample of 119 patients consecutively evaluated in a specialized movement disorders outpatient clinic , we selected 21 PD patients without dementia or comorbid psychiatric conditions . Participants were assigned to three groups of seven subjects each who were treated with placebo , cannabidiol ( CBD ) 75 mg/day or CBD 300 mg/day . One week before the trial and in the last week of treatment participants were assessed in respect to ( i ) motor and general symptoms score ( UPDRS ) ; ( ii ) well-being and quality of life ( PDQ-39 ) ; and ( iii ) possible neuroprotective effects ( BDNF and H ( 1 ) - MRS ) . We found no statistically significant differences in UPDRS scores , plasma BDNF levels or H ( 1 ) - MRS measures . However , the groups treated with placebo and CBD 300 mg/day had significantly different mean total scores in the PDQ-39 ( p = 0.05 ) . Our findings point to a possible effect of CBD in improving quality of life measures in PD patients with no psychiatric comorbidities ; however , studies with larger samples and specific objectives are required before definitive conclusions can be drawn .\",\n",
       " ' Gait training for patients with hemiparesis is carried out independently overground or on a treadmill . Several studies have shown differences in hemiparetic gait parameters during overground versus treadmill walking . However , few studies have compared the effects of these 2 gait training conditions on gait parameters , and no study has compared the short-term effects of these techniques on all biomechanical gait parameters . To determine whether a gait training session performed overground or on a treadmill induces specific short-term effects on biomechanical gait parameters in patients with hemiparesis . Twenty-six subjects with hemiparesis were randomly assigned to a single session of either overground or treadmill gait training . The short-term effects on spatiotemporal , kinematic , and kinetic gait parameters were assessed using gait analysis before and immediately after the training and after a 20-minute rest . Speed , cadence , percentage of single support phase , peak knee extension , peak propulsion , and braking on the paretic side were significantly increased after the gait training session . However , there were no specific changes dependent on the type of gait training performed ( overground or on a treadmill ) . A gait training session performed by subjects with hemiparesis overground or on a treadmill did not induce specific short-term effects on biomechanical gait parameters . The increase in gait velocity that followed a gait training session seemed to reflect specific modifications of the paretic lower limb and adaptation of the nonparetic lower limb .',\n",

To determine the feasibility of conducting virtual visits directly into the homes of individuals with HD , to assess the reliability of conducting remote versus in-person motor assessments , and to determine the test-retest reliability of conducting motor assessments remotely . Individuals with mild to moderate HD underwent baseline in-person clinic assessments and completed a HD care survey . Participants were randomized to receive three virtual visits from one of two physicians over four months that included a modified Unified Huntington 's Disease Rating Scale motor examination ( excluding rigidity and balance assessments ) via web-based video conferencing . Intraclass coefficients ( ICC ) were calculated to determine the level of agreement between remote and in-person assessments . Participants also completed a survey on their interest in telemedicine . Thirteen individuals underwent baseline assessments , eleven ( 85 % ) participants completed at least one virtual visit , and 27 ( 82 % ) of 33 total virtual visits were completed . Remote motor scores demonstrated good reliability ( ICC = 0.78 ; n = 11 ) compared to in-person motor scores . Test-retest reliability of motor scores conducted remotely was excellent ( ICC = 0.90 ; n = 11 ) . Participants expressed moderate future interest in using virtual visits to participate in research and to receive care . In this pilot study , virtual visits into the home were feasible and reliable for conducting motor assessments in HD .

       " ' To improve adolescent notification of positive sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) tests using mobile phone technology and STI information cards . A randomized intervention among 14 - to 21-year olds in a pediatric emergency department ( PED ) . A 2 3 factorial design with replication was used to evaluate the effectiveness of six combinations of two factors on the proportion of STI-positive adolescents notified within 7days of testing . Independent factors included method of notification ( call , text message , or call + text message ) and provision of an STI information card with or without a phone number to obtain results . Covariates for logistic regression included age , empiric STI treatment , days until first attempted notification , and documentation of confidential phone number . Approximately half of the 383 females and 201 males enrolled were 18years of age . Texting only or type of card was not significantly associated with patient notification rates , and there was no significant interaction between card and notification method . For females , successful notification was significantly greater for call + text message ( odds ratio , 3.2 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.4-6 .9 ) , and documenting a confidential phone number was independently associated with successful notification ( odds ratio , 3.6 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.7-7 .5 ) . We found no significant predictors of successful notification for males . Of patients with a documented confidential phone number who received a call + text message , 94 % of females and 83 % of males were successfully notified . Obtaining a confidential phone number and using call + text message improved STI notification rates among female but not male adolescents in a pediatric emergency department .',\n",

       " ' Traditional rotation-based models of placebo nausea are limited because they do not have vehicle settings and are tied to their context . The present study introduces a new model for examining placebo-induced nausea in the laboratory that overcomes these limitations , namely , Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation ( GVS ) . GVS stimulates the vestibular system to cause nausea through sensory mismatch with visual cues and importantly has a non-nauseating placebo setting . Using this , we tested whether conditioning could elicit placebo nausea when participants were later exposed to placebo stimulation as well as whether this placebo nausea was generalised across contexts -- something that is extremely difficult to test with rotation-based models of placebo nausea . Thirty healthy undergraduate students were randomised to receive either placebo GVS ( controls ) or active GVS during training ( Context-Consistent and Context-Change ) . On test , all groups received placebo GVS . The controls and Context-Consistent groups were tested in the same context as training , whereas the Context-Change group was tested in a new context . Participants conditioned with nausea during training had significantly higher nausea symptom ratings after placebo stimulation on test than those given no conditioning . This placebo-induced nausea also generalised to a novel test context with no differences observed between the Context-Change and Context-Consistent groups . GVS provides a new model of placebo-induced nausea that overcomes limitations to traditional rotation-based paradigms . Future studies should use this device to explore the effect of instructions and conditioning on the development of placebo nausea and to assess the efficacy of conditioning-based interventions for clinical use .',\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the use of adhesive on the formation of biofilm on the internal surface of complete dentures and the palatal mucosa of denture wearers . Thirty participants with well-fitting complete dentures were randomly divided according to the experimental design : protocol 1 , adhesive use during the first 15 days , followed by no use of adhesive over the next 15 days ; protocol 2 , no use of adhesives during the first 15 days , followed by adhesive use over the next 15 days . After each period , material from the mucosa and intaglio of the maxillary dentures was collected . Replicate aliquots were plated onto Petri dishes containing selective media for Candida spp , Streptococcus mutans , and a nonselective culture medium . Colony-forming units were expressed as log ( CFU +1 ) / mL . In addition , the internal surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were stained and photographed . From the photographs , the total internal surface and the surface stained with biofilm were quantified ( software ImageTool 3.00 ) , and the percentage of the biofilm-covered area ( % ) on the maxillary and mandibular dentures was calculated and compared with 2-way ANOVA . For the nonselective culture medium , data were compared with the paired-sample t test , and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the colony counts of Candida spp and Streptococcus mutans ( = .05 ) . Similar colony counts were found with or without the use of adhesive for the mucosa and internal surfaces of maxillary dentures , irrespective of the culture medium ( P > .05 ) . The area of dentures covered with biofilm was influenced by the use of adhesive ( P = .025 ) , regardless of the type of denture ( P = .121 ) . The use of adhesive did not alter the colony counts of microorganisms from the palatal mucosa and maxillary dentures of complete denture wearers during the 15-day period , but it did influence the area covered with biofilm on the internal surfaces of the complete dentures .',\n",

The primary outcome was induction of sustained unresponsiveness 2 to 5 weeks after discontinuation of treatment ( referred to as possible sustained unresponsiveness ) . Secondary outcomes were desensitization , peanut skin prick test , and specific IgE and specific IgG4 measurements . Sixty-two children were randomized and stratified by age ( 5 and > 5 years ) and peanut skin test wheal size ( 10 and > 10 mm ) ; 56 reached the trial 's end . Baseline demographics were similar across groups . Possible sustained unresponsiveness was achieved in 82.1 % receiving PPOIT and 3.6 % receiving placebo ( P < .001 ) . Nine children need to be treated for 7 to achieve sustained unresponsiveness ( number needed to treat , 1.27 ; 95 % CI , 1.06-1 .59 ) . Of the subjects , 89.7 % receiving PPOIT and 7.1 % receiving placebo were desensitized ( P < .001 ) . PPOIT was associated with reduced peanut skin prick test responses and peanut-specific IgE levels and increased peanut-specific IgG4 levels ( all P < .001 ) . PPOIT-treated participants reported a greater number of adverse events , mostly with maintenance home dosing . This is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the novel coadministration of a probiotic and peanut OIT and assessing sustained unresponsiveness in children with peanut allergy . PPOIT was effective in inducing possible sustained unresponsiveness and immune changes that suggest modulation of the peanut-specific immune response . Further work is required to confirm sustained unresponsiveness after a longer period of secondary peanut elimination and to clarify the relative contributions of probiotics versus OIT .\",\n",
       " ' Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is a common inflammatory skin disease with a global prevalence ranging from 3 % to 20 % . Patients with AD have an increased risk for complications after viral infection ( eg , herpes simplex virus ) , and vaccination of patients with AD with live vaccinia virus is contraindicated because of a heightened risk of eczema vaccinatum , a rare but potentially lethal complication associated with smallpox vaccination . We sought to develop a better understanding of immunity to cutaneous viral infection in patients with AD . In a double-blind randomized study we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated yellow fever virus ( YFV ) vaccination of nonatopic subjects and patients with AD after standard subcutaneous inoculation or transcutaneous vaccination administered with a bifurcated needle . Viremia , neutralizing antibody , and antiviral T-cell responses were analyzed for up to 30 days after vaccination . YFV vaccination administered through either route was well tolerated . Subcutaneous vaccination resulted in higher seroconversion rates than transcutaneous vaccination but elicited similar antiviral antibody levels and T-cell responses in both the nonatopic and AD groups . After transcutaneous vaccination , both groups mounted similar neutralizing antibody responses , but patients with AD demonstrated lower antiviral T-cell responses by 30 days after vaccination . Among transcutaneously vaccinated subjects , a significant inverse correlation between baseline IgE levels and the magnitude of antiviral antibody and CD4 ( + ) T-cell responses was observed . YFV vaccination of patients with AD through the transcutaneous route revealed that high baseline IgE levels provide a potential biomarker for predicting reduced virus-specific immune memory after transcutaneous infection with a live virus .',\n",

       " \" The prognostic significance of long-term visit-to-visit blood pressure variability ( BPV ) has not yet been validated in `` real world '' hypertensive patients . The aim of the current study is to explore the prognostic value of BPV on stroke in hypertensive patients . This was a dynamic prospective cohort study based on electronic medical records in Shanghai , China . Hypertensive patients ( N = 122,636 ) without history of stroke at baseline , were followed up from 2005 to 2011 . The cohort comprised of 4522 stroke patients and 118,114 non-stroke patients during a mean follow-up duration of 48 months . BPV was measured by standard deviation ( SD ) and the coefficient of variation ( CV ) of blood pressure . The visit-to-visit variability of both systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) was independently associated with the occurrence of stroke [ SD : the hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals ) of SBP and DBP were 1.042 ( 1.021 to 1.064 ) and 1.052 ( 1.040 to 1.065 ) ; CV : the hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals ) of SBP and DBP were 1.183 ( 1.010 to 1.356 ) and 1.151 ( 1.005 to 1.317 ) , respectively ] . The hazard ratio values increased along with an increase of the BPV levels of SBP and DBP . The increment effect remained significant after controlling the blood pressure control status of subjects . Increased BPV of both SBP and DBP , independent of the average blood pressure , is a predictor of stroke among community hypertensive patients in real-world clinical practice . The risk of stroke increased along with increased BPV . Stabilizing BPV might be a therapeutic target in hypertension .\",\n",

Cognitive-behavioral therapy shows promise as a treatment for trichotillomania and might be preferable to pharmacotherapy . However , there have been no randomized , controlled studies of the efficacy of group cognitive-behavioral therapy . We evaluated 44 subjects , recruited from April 2009 to May 2010 , all of whom met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of trichotillomania . Subjects were randomized to receive 22 sessions of either group cognitive-behavioral therapy or group supportive therapy ( control ) . Treatment evaluation was non-blind and used self-report scales . The primary outcome measure was the improvement of hair-plucking behavior as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale . Secondary measures included scores on the Beck Depression Inventory , the Beck Anxiety Inventory , and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report . Both groups showed significant posttreatment improvement in the scores from the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale ( F = 23.762 , P < .001 ) and the Beck Depression Inventory ( F = 6.579 , P = .003 ) . The decrease in hair-plucking behavior over time was significantly greater in the study group than in the control group ( F = 3.545 , P < .038 ) .

This study aimed to determine effects of long-term GH treatment and puberty on BMD of total body ( BMDTB ) , lumbar spine ( BMDLS ) , and bone mineral apparent density of the lumbar spine ( BMADLS ) in children with PWS . This was a prospective longitudinal study of a Dutch PWS cohort . Seventy-seven children with PWS who remained prepubertal during GH treatment for 4 years and 64 children with PWS who received GH treatment for 9 years participated in the study . The children received GH treatment , 1 mg/m ( 2 ) / day ( 0.035 mg/kg/d ) . BMDTB , BMDLS , and BMADLS was measured by using the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry machine for all annual measurements . In the prepubertal group , BMDTB standard deviation score ( SDS ) and BMDLSSDS significantly increased during 4 years of GH treatment whereas BMADLSSDS remained stable . During adolescence , BMDTBSDS and BMADLSSDS decreased significantly , in girls from the age of 11 years and in boys from the ages of 14 and 16 years , respectively , but all BMD parameters remained within the normal range . Higher Tanner stages tended to be associated with lower BMDTBSDS ( P = .083 ) and a significantly lower BMADLSSDS ( P = .016 ) . After 9 years of GH treatment , lean body mass SDS was the most powerful predictor of BMDTBSDS and BMDLSSDS in adolescents with PWS . This long-term GH study demonstrates that BMDTB , BMDLS , and BMADLS remain stable in prepubertal children with PWS but decreases during adolescence , parallel to incomplete pubertal development . Based on our findings , clinicians should start sex hormone therapy from the age of 11 years in girls and 14 years in boys unless there is a normal progression of puberty .',\n",
       " ' To examine disordered eating and associations with health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) in rural overweight/obese ( OW/OB ) children . Cross-sectional analyses were conducted with 272 rural OW/OB children aged 8-12 years ( M = 10.36 ; SD = 1.39 ) . Child anthropometrics , demographics , disordered eating attitudes , unhealthy weight control behaviors ( UWCBs ) , and HRQOL were measured . Relationships between these variables were analyzed using bootstrapped multiple linear regressions . Clinically significant disordered eating attitudes were endorsed by 17 % of the sample , and the majority endorsed UWCBs . Disordered eating attitudes and weight status were the most common predictors of HRQOL . Disordered eating attitudes and UWCBs were negatively related to emotional HRQOL but were unrelated to social , school , or physical HRQOL . Disordered eating is a serious and relevant problem in OW/OB children living in rural areas and may be indicative of impairments in emotional functioning . Early intervention may reduce the risk for eating disorders and associated negative sequelae .',\n",

At 5 years , the probabilities of event-free survival and survival were 74 % ( 1 % ) and 82 % ( 1 % ) for all 5,060 eligible patients , 81 % and 90 % for the SR ( n = 1,564 ) , 75 % and 83 % for the IR ( n = 2,650 ) , and 55 % and 62 % for the HR ( n = 846 ) groups , respectively . No improvement was accomplished by more intense and/or prolonged DI . The ALL IC-BFM 2002 trial is a good example of international collaboration in pediatric oncology . A wide platform of countries able to run randomized studies in ALL has been established . Although the alternative DI did not improve outcome compared with standard treatment and the overall results are worse than those achieved by longer established leukemia groups , the national results have generally improved .',\n",
       " \" To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycinfor treatment of uncomplicated pediatric scrub typhus . A randomized controlled trial was performed . We compared azithromycin with doxycycline or chloramphenicol in uncomplicated pediatric scrub typhus from inpatient pediatric department of Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital . The primary outcome was cure rate at day 3 . The secondary outcomes were timing to defervescence within 72 hours , side effects , and relapsed rate . We compared data between both groups with Fisher 's exact test or Mann-Whitney U test , and failure rate was demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-rank test . We included 57 patients , ofwhom , 28 were assigned to doxycycline or chloramphenicol ( control group ) and 29 to azithromycin ( study group ) . The baseline characteristics of both groups were similar The cure rate was 85.7 % in the doxycycline or chloramphenicol group , as compared to 79.3 % in the azithromycin group ( p = 0.73 ) , and a median time to defervescence was 30 hours ( IQR 21 , 48 ) vs. 36 hours ( IQR 20 , 68 ) respectively ( p = 0.166 ) . There was a little minor side effect in azithromycin group . No relapsed was found in either groups . Azithromycin was as effective as doxycycline or chloramphenicol in treatment of uncomplicated pediatric scrub typhus .\",\n",
       " \" Obesity in youth remains a major public health issue . Yet no effective long-term preventive strategy exists . We previously showed that a school-based socio-ecological approach targeting behavior and social/environmental influences on physical activity ( PA ) prevented 4-year excessive weight gain in 12-year olds . In this study , we investigated if this efficacy persists 30 months after intervention cessation . The program targeted students , family , school and the living environment to promote/support PA and prevent sedentary behavior ( SB ) . A total of 732 students from eight randomized middle schools completed the 4-year trial . At the 30-month post-trial follow-up , body mass index ( BMI ) , fat mass index ( FMI ) , leisure PA ( LPA ) , home/school/workplace active commuting , TV/video time ( TVT ) , and attitudes toward PA were measured in 531 adolescents . The beneficial effects of the intervention on the excess BMI increase ( +0.01 vs +0.34 kgm ( -2 ) in the intervention and control groups , respectively ) and on the overweight incidence in initially non-overweight students ( 4.3 % vs 8.6 % ; odds ratio = 0.48 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.23-1 .01 ) ) were maintained at the post-trial follow-up . LPA was not maintained at the level achieved during the trial . However , we still observed a prevention of the age-related decrease of the adolescents ' percentage reporting regular LPA ( -14.4 % vs -26.5 % ) and a higher intention to exercise in the intervention group . The intervention promoted lower TVT ( -14.0 vs +13.6 min per day ) and higher active commuting changes ( +11.7 % vs -4.8 % ) . Trends in higher BMI reduction in students with high initial TVT and in the least wealthy group were noted . TVT changes throughout the follow-up predicted excess BMI and FMI changes . Long-term multilevel approach targeting PA and SB prevents excessive weight gain up to 30 months after intervention cessation . The efficacy may be higher in the most sedentary and least wealthy adolescents . Healthy PA-related behavior inducing long-lasting weight effects can be promoted in youth providing that an ecological approach is introduced in the prevention strategy .\",\n",
       " ' Adolescents with chronic disease ( ACD ) must develop independent disease self-management and learn to communicate effectively with their health care team to transition from pediatric to adult-oriented health care systems . Disease-specific interventions have been implemented to aid specific ACD groups through transition . A generic approach might be effective and cost-saving . Eighty-one ACD , aged 12 to 20 years , were recruited for a randomized clinical trial evaluating an 8-month transition intervention ( MD2Me ) . MD2Me recipients received a 2-month intensive Web-based and text-delivered disease management and skill-based intervention followed by a 6-month review period . MD2Me recipients also had access to a texting algorithm for disease assessment and health care team contact . The intervention was applicable to adolescents with diverse chronic illnesses . Controls received mailed materials on general health topics . Disease management , health-related self-efficacy , and health assessments were performed at baseline and at 2 and 8 months . Frequency of patient-initiated communications was recorded over the study period . Outcomes were analyzed according to assigned treatment group over time . MD2Me recipients demonstrated significant improvements in performance of disease management tasks , health-related self-efficacy , and patient-initiated communications compared with controls . Outcomes in ACD improved significantly among recipients of a generic , technology-based intervention . Technology can deliver transition interventions to adolescents with diverse chronic illnesses , and a generic approach offers a cost-effective means of positively influencing transition outcomes . Further research is needed to determine whether improved short-term outcomes translate into an improved transition for ACD .',\n",

The current prospective cohort study evaluated whether variation in KIR genes is associated with HIV infection in discordant couples ( DCs ) , where one spouse remains seronegative ( HSN ) despite repeated exposure to the HIV . KIR was genotyped using PCR SSP . Viral load and CD4 counts were estimated using commercially available reagents . Data were analyzed using SPSS software . Among the 47 DCs , HSN spouses had significantly ( P = 0.006 ) higher frequencies of KIR3DS1 . Regression analysis revealed significant ( P = 0.009 ) association of KIR2DS1 with low viral load . KIR2DS4 variant was associated ( P = 0.032 ) with high viral load . Three pairs of KIR genes were in strong LD in HSNs and two pairs in HSPs . There were 60 KIR genotypes , and 16 are reported the first time in the Indian population . Exclusive genotypes were present either in HSPs ( N = 22 , 11 unique genotypes ) or in HSNs ( n = 27 , 9 unique genotypes ) . This study highlights for the first time in the Indian population an association of KIR genes in HIV infection where presence of exclusive and unique genotypes indicates possible association with either HIV infection or with protection .',\n",
       " ' Allergic rhinitis ( AR ) is an inflammatory condition of the nasal mucosa characterized by symptoms of nasal discharge , itching , sneezing , and congestion . Ocular symptoms are commonly associated with AR and include itching or burning , tearing or watering , and redness . Intranasal corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment , and their effect on nasal symptoms is well described . To demonstrate that a 14-day course of 200 g/d of nasal fluticasone propionate is superior to placebo in relieving ocular symptoms associated with AR . This was a randomized , double-blind , parallel group , multicenter study comparing 200 g/d of fluticasone propionate with placebo in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis . The primary end point was mean change from baseline in patient-rated reflective total ocular symptom score ( rTOSS ) . Key secondary end points included mean change from baseline in the morning and evening rTOSS , end-of-treatment assessment of response , and effect on activities of daily living . The primary analysis was performed using analysis of covariance with a linear fixed-effects model . Fluticasone was statistically significantly more efficacious in reducing the ocular symptoms of AR than placebo . The least squares mean difference in the change from baseline of rTOSS was -0.36 ( P = .002 ) . A statistically significant difference in mean change from baseline was observed in favor of fluticasone for morning and evening rTOSS . Significantly more patients taking fluticasone achieved an overall response compared with placebo . Fluticasone had a significantly greater effect on daily living activities and was well tolerated . This study supports the efficacy of fluticasone in treating ocular symptoms associated with AR . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT01817790 .',\n",

To describe our trial statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) . This is an ongoing trial conducted in two phases . In the preparatory observational phase , we collect three sets of baseline data : ICU characteristics ; patient characteristics , processes of care and outcomes ; and completed safety attitudes questionnaires ( SAQs ) . In the randomised phase , ICUs are assigned to the experimental or control arms and we collect patient data and repeat the SAQ . Our SAP includes the prespecified model for the primary and secondary outcome analyses , which account for the cluster-randomised design and availability of baseline data . We also detail the multiple mediation models that we will use to assess our secondary hypothesis ( that the effect of the intervention on inhospital mortality is mediated not only through care processes targeted by the checklist , but also through changes in safety culture ) . We describe our approach to sensitivity and subgroup analyses and missing data . We report our SAP before closing our study database and starting analysis . We anticipate that this should prevent analysis bias and enhance the utility of results .',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study is to investigate if therapeutic weight loss reduces P wave dispersion . 20 obese patients ( 10 males and 10 females ) , part of a randomized clinical trial , were examined over a 6 month period . They were treated with a diet , aiming at 5 % weight loss at the 6th month . After physical examination , they underwent laboratory tests , bioelectrical impedance analysis and a electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . ECGs were transferred to a personal computer via a scanner and then magnified 400 times . We examined at baseline and at the 6th month , maximum and minimum P-wave duration , P-wave dispersion and heart rate . Comparing responders ( patients who lost 5 % of weight at t6 ) and not responders ( who lost less than 5 % ) , responders showed a significant reduction of P wave dispersion value ( -0.38 [ SD : 0.35 ] mm equal to -32.3 [ SD : 11.3 ] % p = 0.00001 ) . All responders present a reduction of P wave dispersion , while for not-responders this is no longer evident . Finally , a good degree of correlation ( r = 0.54 ) between P wave dispersion difference and the decrease of weight was noticed . Females have a better response in P dispersion reduction strictly connected with their weight loss with a good correlation , ( r = 0.7 , p = 0.002 ) , versus a moderate correlation evidenced in males ( r = 0.5 , p = 0.011 ) . P wave duration and dispersion are significantly reduced in patients who lost more than 5 % of weight and this decrease is highly related to the extent of weight loss .',\n",

       " ' To evaluate the effect of automated tube voltage selection on radiation dose and image quality at cardiovascular CT angiography ( CTA ) . We retrospectively analysed paired studies in 72 patients ( 41 male , 60.516.5 years ) , who had undergone CTA acquisitions of the heart or aorta both before and after the implementation of an automated x-ray tube voltage selection algorithm ( ATVS ) . All other parameters were kept identical between the two acquisitions . Subjective image quality ( IQ ) was rated and objective IQ was measured by image noise , signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) and figure of merit ( FOM ) . Image quality parameters and effective dose were compared between acquisitions . Overall subjective image quality improved with the percentage of cases scored as adequate or higher increasing from 79 % to 92 % after implementation of ATVS ( P = 0.03 ) . SNR ( 14.15.9 , 15.76.1 , P = 0.009 ) , CNR ( 11.65.3 , 13.25.6 , P = 0.011 ) , and FOM ( 19.923.3 , 43.851.1 , P < 0.001 ) were significantly higher after implementation of ATVS . Mean image noise ( 24.18.4 HU , 22.77.1 HU , P = 0.048 ) and mean effective dose ( 10.65.9 mSv , 8.85.0 mSv , P = 0.003 ) were significantly lower after implementation of ATVS . Automated tube voltage selection can operator-independently optimize cardiovascular CTA image acquisition parameters with improved image quality at reduced dose . Automatic tube voltage selection optimizes tube voltage for each individual patient . In this population , overall radiation dose decreased while image quality improved . This tool may become valuable for improving dose/quality ratio .',\n",
       " ' Inhaled corticosteroids ( ICSs ) are widely used in asthma control . Ciclesonide ( CIC ) is an ICS with on-site lung activation for potent anti-inflammatory activity . This study aimed to compare the clinical benefit of CIC with budesonide ( BUD ) in step-down therapy . A total of 150 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma well controlled by a combination of ICS and long-acting 2-agonist were randomised to receive either CIC 320g ( n = 75 ) once daily or 2 inhalations of BUD 200g ( n = 75 ) twice daily for 12 weeks . The forced expiratory volume in 1s ( FEV1 ) , maximum mid-expiratory flow ( MMEF ) and asthma control test ( ACT ) scores were measured . Ranked stratification of patients and physicians was assessed . Drug adherence was significantly higher in the CIC group than in the BUD group ( 76.0 % vs. 58.7 % , P = 0.03 ) . The FEV1 and MMEF remained stable throughout the 12-week CIC treatment . In the BUD group , FEV1 significantly decreased at weeks 4 and 12 . MMEF had a higher value in the CIC group than in the BUD group . Both patients and physicians ranked CIC over BUD . CIC is more effective and has better drug adherence than BUD as step-down treatment when asthma is well controlled by combination therapy .',\n",
       " \" The efficacy of psychodynamic therapy ( PDT ) for depression is debated due to a paucity of high-quality studies . We compared short psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy ( SPSP ) to cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) in a randomized clinical trial . We used therapist-rated outcomes to examine how the course of change during treatment could be best represented and to compare treatment efficacy , hypothesizing non-significant differences . Three hundred and forty-one adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for a depressive episode and with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) scores 14 were randomized to 16 sessions of individual manualized CBT or SPSP . Severely depressed patients ( HAM-D > 24 ) received additional antidepressant medication . After each session , therapists rated the Clinical Global Impression Scale subscales ` Severity of Illness ' ( CGI-S ) and ` Global Improvement ' ( CGI-I ) , and the DSM-IV Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning Scale ( GAF ) . We fitted growth curves using mixed model analyses with intention-to-treat samples . CGI-S and GAF scores during treatment were best represented by a linear symptom decrease . CGI-I scores were best represented by an S-shaped curve with relative more improvement in the first and last phases than in the middle phase of treatment . No significant post-treatment treatment differences were found . A non-significant trend for a treatment effect on CGI-S scores vanished when controlling for therapist gender and profession . Therapists were not specifically trained for CGI and GAF assessments . These findings add to the evidence-base of PDT for depression . Therapist characteristics and differences between severity and improvement measures might influence ratings and need to be taken into account when using therapist-rated outcome measures .\",\n",

This is a substudy of a multicenter , randomized , controlled pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of the Asthma APGAR system in primary care practices . As part of the study , enrolled patients completed both the ACT/CACT and the Asthma APGAR system between March 1 , 2011 , and December 31 , 2011 . Kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the results of questionnaires . Of the 468 patients in our sample , 306 ( 65 % ) were classified as not controlled by the ACT/CACT or the Asthma APGAR system . The overall agreement was 84.4 % , with a kappa value of .68 ( substantial agreement ) and a McNemar test P value of .35 ( suggesting no significant difference in the direction of disagreement ) . Of those with poor control as defined by the Asthma APGAR system , 23.8 % ( 73 ) had no controller medications and 76.5 % ( 234 ) were seldom or sometimes able to avoid identified triggers for their asthma . Of those who stated that they had been prescribed controller medications , 116 of 332 ( 35 % ) stated that they did not use the controller medication on a daily basis . The Asthma APGAR system and the ACT/CACT similarly assess asthma control in a multicenter primary care-based sample . The Asthma APGAR system identified an `` actionable item '' in more than 75 % ( 234 ) of the individuals with poor asthma control , thus linking an assessment of poor asthma control with a management strategy .\",\n",
       " ' To evaluate the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) as a method for monitoring the activity of otospongiotic lesions before and after clinical treatment . Prospective , randomized , controlled , double-blind study . One single tertiary care institution in a large , cosmopolitan city . Twenty-six patients ( n = 42 ears ) with clinical , audiometric , and tomographic diagnosis of otosclerosis were enrolled . If computed tomography ( CT ) demonstrated active lesions , these patients underwent MRI to detect otospongiotic foci , seen as areas of gadolinium enhancement . Patients were divided into 3 groups and received treatment with placebo , sodium alendronate , or sodium fluoride for 6 months . After this period , clinical and audiometric evaluations and a second MRI were performed . Each MRI was evaluated by both a neuroradiologist and an otolaryngologist in a subjective ( visual ) and objective ( using specific eFilm Workstation software ) manner . Otospongiosis was most predominantly identified in the region anterior to the oval window , and this site was reliable for comparing pre - and posttreatment scans . The patients in the alendronate and sodium fluoride groups had MRI findings that suggested a decrease in activity of otospongiotic lesions , more relevant in the alendronate group . These findings were statistically significant for both subjective and objective MRI evaluations . MRI shows higher sensitivity than clinical or audiometric assessment for detecting reduction in activity of otospongiosis . The objective MRI evaluation based on software analysis was the most accurate method of monitoring clinical treatment response in otospongiosis .',\n",

This substudy examines 2-year outcomes in the Japanese and non-Japanese cohorts . Patients with 1 or 2 de novo native coronary artery lesions ( baseline vessel diameter 2.50 mm to 4.25 mm and length 24mm ) were randomized 1:1 to PtCr-EES ( N = 63 patients in Japan ) versus CoCr-EES ( N = 61 patients in Japan ) . Several significant differences were noted in baseline demographics , lesion characteristics , and procedural technique between Japanese and non-Japanese patients , including longer fluoroscopy time , less use of contrast , and greater post-dilatation usage and maximum pressure in Japan . Dual antiplatelet usage at 2 years was also higher in Japan . Despite these differences , the 2-year rates of target lesion failure were comparable in patients treated with PtCr-EES and CoCr-EES both in Japan ( 3.2 % vs 5.0 % respectively , p = 0.68 ) and outside Japan ( 4.7 % vs 5.9 % respectively , p = 0.33 ; p for interaction = 0.82 ) .

Benzydamine hydrochloride is a topically-applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) . The authors evaluated the analgesic effect of benzydamine hydrochloride dripping on the ETT cuff on POST . Eighty-six patients participated in this randomized controlled trial . They were assigned into either the benzydamine hydrochloride or the control group . The whole ETT cuff was dripped either with 3 ml ( 4.5 mg ) of benzydamine hydrochloride or nothing five minutes prior to anesthesia induction . The incidence and severity of POST at 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 and 24 hours postoperatively were assessed . The potential adverse effects of benzydamine hydrochloride ( throat numbness throat burning sensation , dry mouth , and thirst ) were also evaluated . Twenty-five patients ( 58.14 % ) in each group had POST ( p-value = 1 ) . The severity of POST ( calculated from affected patients ) in both groups at different time points was not significantly different . Patients in the benzydamine hydrochloride group did not have a higher incidence of adverse effects . We found that dripping benzydamine hydrochloride on the ETT cuff neither reduced the incidence of POST nor increased the incidence of adverse effects in comparison with no intervention .',\n",

Five hundred fourteen patients completed a postal screening questionnaire inquiring about 22 problems . The intervention group ( IG ) received an automated data analysis with individualized written advice on appropriate health services , and the control group received usual care . Main outcomes were health-related quality of life and social participation . Secondary outcomes included health care utilization , number of screened problems , and self-management skills . After 12 months , small beneficial effects were seen for all primary outcomes in the IG : EuroQol visual analog scale score ( difference between IG and control group : 4.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 7.7-1 .0 ; P = 0.011 ) , index for measuring participation restriction ( IMET ) score ( difference between IG and control group : 0.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.07-0 .62 ; P = 0.013 ) . The number of disability days improved only in the IG . The IG reported significantly fewer outpatient visits , fewer disease-related problems , and improved self-management skills ( health education impact questionnaire scores ) with no increase in disease activity , hospital stays , or consultations with allied health professionals . Our activation and information procedure is effective and beneficial . Further studies might show its usefulness in comprehensive management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases .\",\n",

Patients in RAT group were treated according to principle of antibiotics usage , while in PCT group patients ' PCT value was observed everyday . When no active symptoms of infection were shown , and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II ( APACHEII ) scores declined , PCT value decreased over 90 % or PCT value lower than 0.25 g/L time point were selected as drug withdrawal indication . The general status of the patient , antimicrobial drug use time , and prognosis were compared between the two groups , and Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival curve analysis . Variance analysis was used for repeating measurement to observe dynamic serum PCT level of the two groups of patients for survival and death during 7 days . Mann-Whitney U test or ( 2 ) test showed that there were no statistical significance in age , gender , APACHEII score , blood culture positive rate , sputum culture positive rate , cardiac insufficiency , renal failure , respiratory failure , and ventilator and hemofiltration usage ( all P > 0.05 ) . Log Rank test results showed that the time of antimicrobial drug usage was significantly reduced in PCT group than that in RAT group [ days : 8.10.3 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI 8.3-9 .7 ) vs. 9.30.3 ( 95 % CI 8.7-10 .1 ) , P = 0.013 ] . Kaplan-Meier univariate survival curves showed that the speed of curve declination in PCT group was faster significantly than that in RAT group , suggesting that the time of using antimicrobial drug was shortened . There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay , ICU stay time , number of death in 28 days , number of cases of recurrence in 28 days and clinical cure rate between two groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . PCT level in non-survivors in both groups was significantly higher than that in the survivors , exceeding more than 10 g/L in the early and late stages of treatment . Dynamic monitoring of PCT can effectively reduce antimicrobial drug use in ICU patients with sepsis , but there is no significant difference in patients ' prognosis .\",\n",

Consequently , there was a 31 % decrease in the calculated median therapeutic ( 131 ) I activity after MTZ ( P < .05 ) . No significant changes in 24-hour RAIU were observed after diet . In the MTZ group , median serum TSH levels increased significantly by 9 % and mean serum free T4 and free T3 concentrations decreased by 22 % and 15 % , respectively , whereas no changes in thyroid function were observed in the LID group . Thyroid volume did not significantly change in either of the two groups . At 12 months after radioiodine treatment , median serum TSH was within the normal range in both groups . MTZ treatment before ( 131 ) I therapy resulted in an average 2-fold increase in thyroid RAIU and enhanced the efficiency of radioiodine therapy assessed at 12 months . MTZ pretreatment is therefore a safe , easily accessible alternative to recombinant human TSH stimulation and a more effective option than LID .',\n",

       " ' Surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion ( SARPE ) is the procedure of choice for treatment of adults with transverse maxillary deficiency greater than 7 mm . There is no consensus about the dentoskeletal effect of an orthodontic retainer on the outcome of SARPE . Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of an orthodontic retainer on dentoskeletal stability . Ninety digitized dental casts of 30 adults undergoing SARPE were divided into 2 groups-no retention ( n = 15 ) and retention ( n = 15 ) - and assessed . The dental casts were obtained at 3 checkpoints : ( 1 ) 7 days on average before SARPE ( preoperatively ) , ( 2 ) 4 months after expansion , and ( 3 ) 10 months after expansion was completed . The retention patients received a transpalatal arch just after expander removal , at checkpoint 2 . The transpalatal arch was kept for 10 months after completion of the expansion ( checkpoint 3 and end of the study ) . The dental casts were scanned with a Vivid 9i 3D laser scanner ( Konica Minolta , Wayne , NJ ) . The distances measured were premolar and molar intercusp distances , premolar and molar intercervical distances , premolar and molar inter-WALA ( Will Andrews and Lawrence Andrews ) ridge distances , and palate height at the maxillary first molar . The planned maxillary expansion was within the expected amount ( P < 0.05 ) . Palatal height at the 4-month checkpoint decreased by 0.79 mm ( 4.38 % ) ( P < 0.001 ) and again at the 10-month checkpoint by 0.38 mm ( 0.98 % ) ( P > 0.05 ) but not significantly in both groups . The premolar intercusp distance had a relapse at checkpoint 3 of 1.84 mm ( 7.18 % ) ( P < 0.001 ) in the no-retention group . Both groups had average relapses of 0.95 mm in the premolar intercervical distances , of 0.88 mm in the premolar inter-WALA ridge distances , of 1.04 mm in the molar intercusp distances , of 0.74 mm in the molar intercervical distances , and of 0.84 mm in the molar inter-WALA ridge distances ( P < 0.05 ) at checkpoint 3 . The analysis of relapse in both groups suggests that the use of a transpalatal arch as a retaining device does not improve dento-osseous stability .',\n",

The aim is to assess the efficacy of ADM implantation in the prevention of postoperative scars and adhesions after conventional , open , total thyroidectomy . Forty-four patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to the study ( ADM implantation ) or control group ( without ADM ) . Global photographic assessment , Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) , objective scar assessment , and swallowing impairment index were assessed at baseline , immediately after surgery , and at 1 and 2 months after surgery . Nineteen control and 20 study group participants completed the study . The mean VSS score of the study group was significantly lower than the controls at both 1 month ( 3.06 1.25 vs 4.41 1.54 , respectively ) and 2 months ( 2.76 1.56 vs 4.35 1.58 , respectively ) after surgery . Scar quality measures ( mean melanin and erythema indexes ) were significantly lower in the study group compared with controls . Study group participants had significantly lower swallowing impairment scores than controls . The mean postoperative hospitalization of both groups was not significantly different . Acellular dermal matrix-assisted implants appear to improve post-thyroidectomy scar and swallowing impairments without delays in operation time .',\n",
       " ' Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality . Existing data on cardiac structure and function in HFpEF suggest significant heterogeneity in this population . Echocardiograms were obtained from 935 patients with HFpEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction 45 % ) enrolled in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist ( TOPCAT ) trial before initiation of randomized therapy . Average age was 7010 years , 49 % were women , 14 % were of African descent , and comorbidities were highly prevalent . Centralized quantitative analysis in a blinded core laboratory demonstrated a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 59.37.9 % , with prevalent concentric left ventricular remodeling ( 34 % ) and hypertrophy ( 43 % ) , and left atrial enlargement ( 53 % ) . Diastolic dysfunction was present in 66 % of gradable participants and was significantly associated with greater left ventricular hypertrophy and a higher prevalence of left atrial enlargement . Doppler evidence of pulmonary hypertension was present in 36 % . At least 1 measure of structural heart disease was present in 93 % of patients . Patients enrolled in TOPCAT demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of ventricular remodeling , with high prevalence of structural heart disease , including left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement , in addition to pulmonary hypertension , each of which has been associated with adverse outcomes in HFpEF . Diastolic function was normal in approximately one third of gradable participants , highlighting the heterogeneity of the cardiac phenotype in this syndrome . These findings deepen our understanding of the TOPCAT trial population and expand our knowledge of the diversity of the cardiac phenotype in HFpEF . URL : http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

       " ' This study examined the relationships between treatment fidelity and treatment outcomes in a community-based trial of a 12-Step Facilitation ( TSF ) intervention . In a prior multi-site randomized clinical trial , 234 participants in 10 outpatient drug treatment clinics were assigned to receive the Stimulant Abuser Groups to Engage in 12-Step ( STAGE-12 ) intervention . A secondary analysis reviewed and coded all STAGE-12 sessions for fidelity to the protocol , using the Twelve Step Facilitation Adherence Competence Empathy Scale ( TSF ACES ) . Linear mixed-effects models tested the relationship between three fidelity measures ( adherence , competence , empathy ) and six treatment outcomes ( number of days of drug use and five Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) composite scores ) measured at 3 months post-baseline . Adherence , competence and empathy were robustly associated with improved employment status at follow up . Empathy was inversely associated with drug use , as was competence in a non-significant trend ( p = .06 ) . Testing individual ASI drug composite score items suggested that greater competence was associated with fewer days of drug use and , at the same time , with an increased sense of being troubled or bothered by drug use . Greater competence and empathy in the delivery of a TSF intervention were associated with better drug use and employment outcomes , while adherence was associated with employment outcomes only . Higher therapist competence was associated with lower self-report drug use , and also associated with greater self-report concern about drug use . The nature of TSF intervention may promote high levels of concern about drug use even when actual use is low .',\n",

With Sharp/van der Heijde progression 0.5 points after 1year ( yes/no ) as dependent variable , univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed . Of 428 patients with DXR-BMD results and progression scores available , 28 ( 7 % ) had radiological progression after 1year . Independent predictors for radiological progression were presence of baseline erosions ( OR ( 95 % CI ) 6.5 ( 1.7 to 25 ) ) and early DXR-BMD loss ( OR ( 95 % CI ) 1.5 ( 1.1 to 2.0 ) ) . In 366 ( 86 % ) patients without baseline erosions , early DXR-BMD loss was the only independent predictor of progression ( OR ( 95 % CI ) 2.0 ( 1.4 to 2.9 ) ) . In early RA patients , metacarpal BMD loss after 4months of treatment is an independent predictor of radiological progression after 1year .

Baseline distress was hypothesized as a moderator of intervention effect . Randomized trial . Community-based cancer helplines in Queensland and New South Wales , Australia . 354 patients with cancer and 336 caregivers . Participants were randomized to either a single session of nurse-led self-management intervention or a five-session psychologist cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by telephone . Assessments were undertaken at baseline ( preintervention ) and at 3 , 6 , and 12 months . Psychological and cancer-specific distress and post-traumatic growth . No significant moderation by baseline cancer-specific distress was noted . For low-education patients , only the psychologist intervention was associated with a significant drop in distress . For all other participants , distress decreased over time in both arms with small to large effect sizes ( Cohen 's ds = 0.05-0 .82 ) . Post-traumatic growth increased over time for all participants ( Cohen 's ds = 0.6-0 .64 ) . Many distressed patients with cancer and their caregivers may benefit significantly from a single session of a nurse psychoeducation intervention that can be delivered remotely by telephone and supported by self-management materials . Research is needed to develop an algorithm that moves beyond the use of distress as the only indicator for referral to specialist psychological services . Survivors and caregivers with low education and low literacy may require more in-depth and targeted support . Brief nurse psychoeducation and stress management for cancer survivors and caregivers should be considered as part of a tiered approach to psychosocial care .\",\n",

Randomized , double-blind , parallel-group trial conducted between January 2007 and August 2011 , in 47 ambulatory or hospital sites in Germany , Austria , or Switzerland . Eligible participants were aged 60 , had new-onset epilepsy , had no acute illness as the cause of their seizures , and had no contraindication to the drugs in the trial . Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to CR-CBZ , LTG , or LEV . Doses were up-titrated for 6 weeks and could be maintained or adjusted depending on seizure relapse or tolerability over an additional period of 52 weeks . Primary outcome was the retention to treatment at week 58 ; secondary measures related to seizure and adverse event frequency . Of 361 randomized patients , 359 were included ( CR-CBZ n = 121 , LTG n = 117 , LEV n = 122 ) in the modified intent-to-treat population ( mean age [ range ] 71.4 [ 60-95 ] years ) . At week 58 , the retention rate for LEV was significantly higher than for CR-CBZ ( 61.5 % vs. 45.8 % , p = 0.02 ) , and similar to LTG ( 55.6 % ) . Seizure freedom rates at weeks 30 and 58 were not different across the groups .

A cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 pediatric practices in 16 states that received either Clinical and Community Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure ( CEASE ) intervention or usual care . The intervention provided practices with training to provide evidence-based assistance to parents who smoke . The primary outcome , assessed by the 12-month follow-up telephone survey with parents , was provision of meaningful tobacco control assistance , defined as discussing various strategies to quit smoking , discussing smoking cessation medication , or recommending the use of the state quitline after initial enrollment visit . We also assessed parental quit rates at 12 months , determined by self-report and biochemical verification . Practices ' rates of providing any meaningful tobacco control assistance ( 55 % vs 19 % ) , discussing various strategies to quit smoking ( 25 % vs 10 % ) , discussing cessation medication ( 41 % vs 11 % ) , and recommending the use of the quitline ( 37 % vs 9 % ) were all significantly higher in the intervention than in the control groups , respectively ( P < .0001 for each ) , during the 12-month postintervention implementation . Receiving any assistance was associated with a cotinine-confirmed quitting adjusted odds ratio of 1.89 ( 95 % confidence interval : 1.13-3 .19 ) . After controlling for demographic and behavioral factors , the adjusted odds ratio for cotinine-confirmed quitting in intervention versus control practices was 1.07 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.64-1 .78 ) . Intervention practices had higher rates of delivering tobacco control assistance than usual care practices over the 1-year follow-up period . Parents who received any assistance were more likely to quit smoking ; however , parents ' likelihood of quitting smoking was not statistically different between the intervention and control groups . Maximizing parental quit rates will require more complete systems-level integration and adjunctive cessation strategies .\",\n",

Most studies have been limited by small samples sizes and have reported inconsistent associations between the FCGR2A and the FCGR3A polymorphisms and clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) patients treated with cetuximab . We investigated the association of these polymorphisms and clinical outcome in a large cohort of mCRC patients treated with first-line 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and oxaliplatin ( Nordic FLOX ) + / - cetuximab in the NORDIC-VII study ( NCT00145314 ) . 504 and 497 mCRC patients were evaluable for the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotyping , respectively . Genotyping was performed on TaqMan ABI HT 7900 ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) with pre-designed SNP genotyping assays for FCGR2A ( rs1801274 ) and FCGR3A ( rs396991 ) . The response rate for patients with the FCGR2A R/R genotype was significantly increased when cetuximab was added to Nordic FLOX ( 31 % versus 53 % , interaction P = 0.03 ) , but was not significantly different compared to the response rate of patients with the FCGR2A H/H or H/R genotypes given the same treatment .

       " \" There is a large body of evidence for the involvement of the parietal cortex in orientation and navigation in space . This has been supplemented by investigation of the contribution of a number of subregions using transcranial magnetic stimulation . The role of the precuneus area , located in the medial plane of posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) , in visuospatial functions is not well understood . We investigated the contribution of this area using the landmark task . Participants were asked to make forced-choice judgments of which side of prebisected line was longer for near and far viewing conditions ( 70 and 180cm , respectively ) . Online 10Hz , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) was delivered for 500ms over the right precuneus , rPPC and vertex ( control ) , in separate blocks of trials . The rPPC stimulation was used as a positive control , having previously resulted in `` neglect like '' spatial bias effects in a number of studies . A no-TMS condition showed a leftward spatial bias ( pseudoneglect ) for near space judgments but not for far space and was used as the baseline . Precuneus stimulation resulted in rightward spatial bias from the midpoint in near space similar to the rPPC neglect-like effect . No significant effects were seen with vertex stimulation . This study shows that precuneus , like other parietal areas , is involved in visuospatial functions .

As previously shown , the intervention reduced the rates of first occurrence of both MI and any diabetes-related endpoint . However , for all outcomes , the HR for a second event showed a statistically non-significant tendency to be increased . We estimated a combined HR for all marginal failure times , regardless of whether they were first , second or later events . This showed that the intervention had no effect on the rate of any of the outcomes , including MI ( HR 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.76 , 1.05 ) and any diabetes-related endpoint ( HR 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.87 , 1.09 ) . In the DCGP study , a smaller proportion of patients who received structured care experienced a first occurrence of MI or any diabetes-related endpoint compared with patients who received routine care . However , the patients who received structured care tended to experience more recurrent outcomes , so the total outcome rate was not affected by the intervention .',\n",
       " ' This study sought to report additional safety results from the ROCKET AF ( Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation ) . The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated similar risks of stroke/systemic embolism and major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding ( principal safety endpoint ) with rivaroxaban and warfarin . The risk of the principal safety and component bleeding endpoints with rivaroxaban versus warfarin were compared , and factors associated with major bleeding were examined in a multivariable model . The principal safety endpoint was similar in the rivaroxaban and warfarin groups ( 14.9 vs. 14.5 events/100 patient-years ; hazard ratio : 1.03 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.96 to 1.11 ) . Major bleeding risk increased with age , but there were no differences between treatments in each age category ( < 65 , 65 to 74,75 years ; pinteraction = 0.59 ) . Compared with those without ( n = 13,455 ) , patients with a major bleed ( n = 781 ) were more likely to be older , current/prior smokers , have prior gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding , mild anemia , and a lower calculated creatinine clearance and less likely to be female or have a prior stroke/transient ischemic attack . Increasing age , baseline diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) 90 mm Hg , history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or GI bleeding , prior acetylsalicylic acid use , and anemia were independently associated with major bleeding risk ; female sex and DBP < 90 mm Hg were associated with a decreased risk . Rivaroxaban and warfarin had similar risk for major/nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding .

With local research ethics committee 's approval and written informed parental consent , 100 children were randomly divided into groups L ( size 2.0 common laryngeal mask airway ) and S ( size 2.0 laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) ) according to random number ( n = 50 each ) . After anesthesia induction , a common laryngeal mask airway or laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) was inserted and mechanically ventilated . Time and ease for insertion , insertion success rate , airway leak pressure , success rate and ease of disposal sputum collecting tube insertion in group S , quality of airway during anesthetic maintenance , abdominal circumference changes and complications within 24 h post-operation were measured . Compared with group L , abdominal circumference increased less in group S ( 0.90 0.35 vs 0.43 0.18 cm , n = 46 , P < 0.01 ) . No significant inter-group differences existed for other measurements . Disposal sputum collecting tube was successfully placed in group S ( 100 % ) . In children with mechanical ventilation , laryngeal mask airway-Supreme ( TM ) can be effectively applied to maintain a good airway . And the incidence of gastric insufflation is lower . It is particularly useful for those requiring evacuation of gastric contents during general anesthesia .\",\n",
       " ' The purpose of this trial was to evaluate crestal bone level changes radiographically in a standardized fashion over a period of 12 months in humans for implants with a 0.7-mm machined collar ( implant type A ) versus type B implants with a 1.5-mm machined collar . Twenty-five patients with multiple missing teeth in posterior sectors were randomly assigned to one of the two groups : A ( 0.7-mm machined-collar implants ) or B ( 1.5-mm machined-collar implants ) . Changes at crestal bone level were assessed by measuring the shoulder-crest distance ( SCD ) on the mesial and distal aspects of each implant on customized periapical radiographs , which were taken on the day of surgery and 3 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery . Eighty-one implants were included in the study . Mean SCD was 0.54 0.53 mm at baseline and 1.49 0.40 mm after 12 months . For 0.7-mm-collar implants , mean SCD was 1.40 0.39 mm , while it was 1.56 0.40 mm for 1.5-mm-collar implants . Statistically significant differences were found only between the two types of implants for distal measurements at 3 and 12 months after placement . Both 0.7 - and 1.5-mm machined-collar implants can be used with predictable results , as changes in peri-implant crestal bone levels are similar for both implant types and do not seem to be significant from a clinical point of view . The SCD may well depend more on the location of the abutment-implant interface than on machined-collar height .',\n",

The Breathing Outcomes Study , a prospective secondary study to the Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial , assessed respiratory morbidity at 6-month intervals from hospital discharge to 18-22 months corrected age ( CA ) . Two prespecified primary outcomes-wheezing more than twice per week during the worst 2-week period and cough longer than 3 days without a cold-were compared for each randomized intervention . One or more interviews were completed for 918 of the 922 eligible infants . The incidences of wheezing and cough were 47.9 % and 31.0 % , respectively , and did not differ between the study arms of either randomized intervention . Infants randomized to lower vs higher oxygen saturation targets had a similar risk of death or respiratory morbidity ( except for croup and treatment with oxygen or diuretics at home ) . Infants randomized to CPAP vs intubation/surfactant had fewer episodes of wheezing without a cold ( 28.9 % vs 36.5 % ; P < .05 ) , respiratory illnesses diagnosed by a doctor ( 47.7 % vs 55.2 % ; P < .05 ) , and physician or emergency room visits for breathing problems ( 68.0 % vs 72.9 % ; P < .05 ) by 18-22 months CA . Treatment with early CPAP rather than intubation/surfactant is associated with less respiratory morbidity by 18-22 months CA .

This was a multicenter , prospective , randomized , parallel 1:1 , unblinded , controlled trial of infants < 29 weeks ' gestation age , comprising two study groups : experimental group ( total body group ; both the body and head covered with a polyethylene occlusive bag , with the face uncovered ) and control group ( only the body , up to the shoulders , covered with a polyethylene occlusive bag ) . The primary outcome was axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission immediately after wrap removal . One hundred randomly allocated infants ( 50 in the total body group and 50 controls ) completed the study . Mean axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission was similar in the two groups ( 36.50.6 C total body vs 36.40.8 C controls ; P = .53 ) . The rate of moderate hypothermia ( temperature < 36C ) was 12 % in the total body group and 20 % in the control group ( P = .41 ) . Three subjects in each group ( 6.0 % ) had an axillary temperature > 37.5 C on admission , and one subject in control group had an axillary temperature > 38C . Total body wrapping is comparable with covering the body up to the shoulders in preventing postnatal thermal losses in very preterm infants .\",\n",
       " ' Available preclinical and phase 2 clinical data suggest that the addition of cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , to chemotherapy might improve outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . We aimed to assess whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC after platinum-based therapy . In this unmasked , open-label randomised phase 3 trial we enrolled patients with metastatic , unresectable , or locally advanced NSCLC from 121 sites in Canada and the USA . Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older who had experienced progressive disease during or after one previous platinum-based regimen . Initially , patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed ( 500 mg/m ( 2 ) ) or docetaxel ( 75 mg/m ( 2 ) ) and then randomly assigned within each group to receive their chemotherapy with or without cetuximab ( 400 mg/m ( 2 ) at first dose and 250 mg/m ( 2 ) weekly thereafter ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . However , after a change in the standard of care , investigators chose whether to treat with pemetrexed or docetaxel on a patient-by-patient basis . The primary analysis was changed to compare progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed versus pemetrexed , on an intention-to-treat basis . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00095199 . Between Jan 10 , 2005 , and Feb 10 , 2010 , we enrolled 939 patients ; data for one patient was accidentally discarded . Of the remaining 938 patients , 605 received pemetrexed ( 301 patients with cetuximab and 304 alone ) and 333 received docetaxel ( 167 in combination with cetuximab and 166 alone ) . Median progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed was 29 months ( 95 % CI 27-32 ) versus 28 months ( 25-33 ) with pemetrexed ( HR 103 , 95 % CI 087-121 ; p = 076 ) . The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with cetuximab plus pemetrexed were fatigue ( 33 [ 11 % ] of 292 patients ) , acneiform rash ( 31 [ 11 % ] ) , dyspnoea ( 29 [ 10 % ] ) , and decreased neutrophil count ( 28 [ 10 % ] ) , and with pemetrexed alone were dyspnoea ( 35 [ 12 % ] of 289 patients ) , decreased neutrophil count ( 26 [ 9 % ] ) , and fatigue ( 23 [ 8 % ] ) . A significantly higher proportion of patients in the cetuximab plus pemetrexed group ( 119 [ 41 % ] of 292 patients ) experienced at least one serious adverse event than those patients in the pemetrexed group ( 85 [ 29 % ] of 289 patients ; p = 00054 ) . Nine ( 3 % ) of 292 treated patients in the cetuximab and pemetrexed group died of adverse events compared with five ( 2 % ) of 289 treated patients in the pemetrexed alone group .

       " ' Some studies suggest better overall outcomes when right unilateral electroconvulsive therapy ( RUL ECT ) is given with an ultrabrief , rather than brief , pulse width . The aim of the study was to test if ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT results in less cognitive side effects than brief - pulse RUL ECT , when given at doses which achieve comparable efficacy . One hundred and two participants were assigned to receive ultrabrief ( at 8 times seizure threshold ) or brief ( at 5 times seizure threshold ) pulse RUL ECT in a double-blind , randomized controlled trial . Blinded raters assessed mood and cognitive functioning over the ECT course . Efficacy outcomes were not found to be significantly different . The ultrabrief group showed less cognitive impairment immediately after a single session of ECT , and over the treatment course ( autobiographical memory , orientation ) . In summary , when ultrabrief RUL ECT was given at a higher dosage than brief RUL ECT ( 8 versus 5 times seizure threshold ) , efficacy was comparable while cognitive impairment was less .',\n",

After 6-week and 6-month follow-up appointments , the patients were given survey questions that were developed using literature-supported methods to compare follow-up experiences . The patients were monitored for complications . There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person clinic visits ( telemedicine : 89 % satisfied ; control : 100 % satisfied ; P = 0.74 ) . Zero percent of patients in the telemedicine group took time off their work for their appointment compared with 55.6 % in the control ( P = 0.03 ) . Telemedicine patients spent significantly less time on their visits ( P = 0.01 ) . The majority of the patients in the telemedicine group reported clear visual ( 87.5 % ) and sound quality ( 100 % ) through and agreed to future follow-up visits through telemedicine ( 75.0 % ) .

Sustained virologic suppression correlates with regression of histologic fibrosis and cirrhosis . This study evaluated efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) in Asian patients through 240 weeks of treatment . Post hoc analysis of the Asian subpopulation from two phase 3 clinical studies was performed . Following a 48-week randomized , double-blind evaluation of once-daily TDF versus once-daily adefovir dipivoxil , open-label TDF for up to 240 weeks was evaluated . Patients with both baseline and week 240 liver biopsies were evaluated for histologic changes . At baseline , 189/641 ( 29 % ) patients randomized were Asian . Sixty-eight percent of Asian patients were male ; 50 % were hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) - positive . At week 240 , similar proportions of Asian ( 88 % ) and non-Asian ( 87 % ) patients demonstrated improvement in liver histology , and 19/22 ( 86 % ) Asian patients with baseline cirrhosis were no longer cirrhotic . By modified intent-to-treat analysis , 74 % of Asian patients and 76 % of non-Asian patients had HBV DNA < 400 copies/mL at the end of week 240 ( P = 0.602 ) . No differences were seen in HBeAg loss or seroconversion in Asian versus non-Asian patients . No Asian patient experienced hepatitis B surface antigen loss . Safety and tolerability of TDF through week 240 , including changes in renal function and in hip/spine bone mineral density ( from weeks 192 to 240 ) , were comparable between Asian and non-Asian patients .

       " ' To study the effect of exogenous i.m. glucagon on recovery from controlled insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with the novel glucokinase activator AZD1656 , in combination with metformin . This was a single-centre randomized , open , two-way crossover phase I , automated glucose clamp ( Biostator ( ) ; Life Science Instruments , Elkhart , MD , USA ) study ( NCT00817271 ) in eight patients ( seven men and one woman , mean age 58.6 years , body mass index 28.1 kg/m ( 2 ) ) . All patients received a stable dose of metformin twice daily , ranging from 1000 to 2250 mg . A 2-day titration phase commenced with 40 mg AZD1656 twice daily , escalating to 80 mg twice daily if tolerated . This was followed by a single dose of 80 or 160 mg AZD1656 , administered on days 5 and 8 when metabolic studies were performed . After an overnight fast on days 5 and 8 , controlled hypoglycaemia was induced using an exogenous i.v. infusion of insulin . Plasma glucose was lowered in a stepwise fashion over 3 h to attain a target nadir of 2.7 mmol/l . This was sustained for 30 min , at the end of which the hypoglycaemic clamp was released . In random sequence , patients either received an i.m. injection of 1 mg glucagon or were allowed to recover from hypoglycaemia by endogenous counter-regulation . To avoid prolonged hypoglycaemia , a reverse glucose clamp was applied from 4 to 6 h post-dose . Three patients received 40 mg AZD1656 twice daily and five patients 80 mg twice daily . Mean plasma glucose at 20 min after release of the hypoglycaemic clamp was significantly lower ( 3.1 0.3 mmol/l ) for AZD1656 alone than for AZD1656 + glucagon ( 4.9 0.8 mmol/l ; p < 0.001 between the groups ) . Catecholamine and cortisol responses were similar on the AZD1656 + glucagon and AZD alone study days . Growth hormone response was 18 % lower for AZD1656 alone ( p = 0.01 ) , consistent with the effect of a pharmacological dose of glucagon on growth hormone secretion . No safety or tolerability concerns were observed during treatment with AZ1656 . Exogenous glucagon was effective as a rescue treatment for hypoglycaemia induced during treatment with AZD1656 , given in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes .',\n",
       " ' Retrograde intrarenal surgery ( RIRS ) involves a minimally invasive stone surgery , lending itself potential to combined spinal-epidural anesthesia ( CSEA ) , although it is performed preferably under general anesthesia ( GA ) . This prospective randomized study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CSEA for patients undergoing RIRS . Seventy consecutive patients who were scheduled for RIRS were randomized to receive CSEA ( n = 35 ) or GA ( n = 35 ) . Operative time , stone clearance rate , visual analog scale ( VAS ) of pain , complication rate , anesthetic cost , and hospital stay were compared between the two groups . A total of 65 patients randomized to CSEA ( 31 ) or GA ( 34 ) completed the study . In the CSEA group , each procedure was completed and there was no anesthetic conversion . Although based on the prospective randomized method , the GA group still had a little larger stone size ( p = 0.059 ) and more multiple caliceal stones ( p = 0.037 ) . Overall , there were no statistically significant differences in operative time ( p = 0.088 ) , stone fragmentation time ( p = 0.074 ) , postoperative VAS pain score at 6 and 24 hours ( p = 0.156 , 0.146 ) , incidence of complications ( p = 0.870 ) , stone-free rate ( p = 0.804 ) , and hospital stays ( p = 0.907 ) between the two groups . The patients in the GA group experienced a higher mean hemoglobin drop ( 6.53.2 vs 8.62.7 g/L , p = 0.012 ) . In addition , the anesthetic cost was much cheaper in the CSEA group ( 183.831.4 vs 391.959.1 dollars , p < 0.001 ) . RIRS with CSEA can be completed with no anesthetic conversions and with the same efficacy and safety compared with GA. . When considering economical aspects , CSEA appears to be a preferable alternative to GA for the patient whose general health status permits it .',\n",

We therefore assessed the effect of pistachios on postprandial glucose and insulin levels , gut hormones related to satiety and endothelial function . In this randomized crossover study , 20 subjects with metabolic syndrome consumed five study meals over 5-10 weeks . The meals differed in fat type and quantity , but were matched according to available carbohydrates ( CHOs ) . Three meals had 50 g available CHO : white bread ( WB50g ) , white bread , butter and cheese ( WB+B+C h ) and white bread and pistachios ( WB+P ) . Two meals had 12 g available CHO : white bread ( WB12g ) and pistachios ( P ) . Within each group of available CHO meals , postprandial glucose levels were the highest following the white bread-only meals , and glucose response was significantly attenuated when butter and cheese or pistachios were consumed ( P < 0.05 ) . Postprandial insulin levels were highest after the WB+B+C h meal ( P < 0.05 ) , but did not differ between the white bread-only and pistachio meals . Both endothelial function ( reactive hyperemia index ) and arterial stiffness ( augmentation index ) significantly increased after the white bread-only meals compared with the WB+B+C h meal ( all P < 0.05 ) . Insulin secretagogue levels were higher when butter and cheese or pistachios were consumed than when white bread only was consumed ( P < 0.05 ) . Compared with white bread , pistachio consumption reduced postprandial glycemia , increased glucagon-like-peptide levels and may have insulin-sparing properties . These effects could be beneficial for individuals with diabetes and metabolic syndrome .',\n",

The risk of adverse outcome associated with left ventricular hypertrophy was additive to the risk associated with elevated E/E ' . Among heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients enrolled in TOPCAT , left ventricular hypertrophy , higher left ventricular filling pressure , and higher pulmonary artery pressure were predictive of heart failure hospitalization , cardiovascular death , or aborted cardiac arrest independent of clinical and laboratory predictors . These features , both alone and in combination , identify heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients at particularly high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

       " ' The clinical benefits of bioimpedance spectroscopy ( BIS ) - guided fluid management in patients on hemodialysis have been widely demonstrated . However , no previous reports have evaluated the effect of regular and serial BIS-guided fluid management on the residual renal function ( RRF ) in patients on peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) . Therefore , we will evaluate the clinical efficacy of BIS-guided fluid management for preserving RRF and protecting cardiovascular events in patients on PD . This is a multicenter , prospective , randomized controlled trial . A total of 138 participants on PD will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either BIS-guided fluid management or fluid management based only on the clinical information for 1 year . The primary outcome is the change in the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) between months 0 and 12 after starting treatment . The secondary outcomes will include GFR at month 12 , time to the anuric state ( urine volume < 100 ml/day ) , and fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events during treatment . This is the first clinical trial to investigate the effect of BIS-guided fluid management on RRF and for protecting against cardiovascular events in patients on PD .

       " ' This study was performed to compare the mucosal findings after esophagogastroduodenoscopy in two groups before and after the use of alendronate only and following administration of the enteric-coated alendronate ( 5 mg ) and calcitriol ( 0.5 g ) combined drug ( Maxmarvil , Yuyu Co. ) . The study population consisted of 33 postmenopausal healthy female volunteers , aged 50 to 70 years ( mean age , 58 5 ) without gastrointestinal symptoms and with normal baseline endoscopic findings . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed at baseline and was repeated 2 weeks later after daily intake of Maxmarvil ( n = 17 subjects ) or alendronate only ( n = 16 subjects ) . Mucosal injury scores were reported by an endoscopist after 2 weeks of treatment with each medication schedule . Esophageal mucosal injuries developed in two of 16 subjects in the alendronate only group and 0 of 17 in the Maxmarvil group . Gastric mucosal injuries developed in eight subjects in the alendronate group and four subjects in the Maxmarvil group ; this difference was statistically significant . The mucosal damage scores for the alendronate group ( total score 24 ) were significantly higher than those for the Maxmarvil group ( total score 9 ) in the esophagus and stomach . Therefore , this study suggested that enteric-coated Maxmarvil is less harmful to gastrointestinal mucosa than alendronate , and may improve the tolerability of osteoporosis medication in clinical practice .',\n",
       " \" Although antidepressant drugs are used as first-line intervention to treat patients with generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , only one-third of patients respond positively to treatment . In our study , we investigated whether functional genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine active transporter 1 ( DAT1 ) and dopamine receptor D2 ( DRD2 ) may play a role in antidepressant treatment response in GAD . We examined 156 patients diagnosed with GAD who received venlafaxine Extended-Release ( XR ) treatment as part of an 18-month relapse-prevention study to determine whether variation in these genes had an effect on treatment response after 6months of open-label treatment . Genotypes were obtained for rs1076560 ( DRD2 ) , rs1800497 ( DRD2 ) , rs2550948 ( DAT1 ) , and a variable number tandem repeat in the 3 ' untranslated region of the DAT1 gene using standard methods . Results show that none of the tested variants were associated with treatment response to venlafaxine XR in GAD . Genotype and allele frequencies did not differ statistically significantly between responders and non-responders using either the Hamilton Anxiety or Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement Scale at 6months . Although we detected no association in our sample , future studies using larger samples and more comprehensive gene coverage are needed to evaluate potential effects of dopaminergic variants on antidepressant treatment response in anxiety disorders .\",\n",
       " ' In non-small-cell lung cancer , an exon 19 deletion and an L858R point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) are predictors of a response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors . However , it is uncertain whether other uncommon EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors . A post-hoc analysis to assess prognostic factors was performed with the use of patients with EGFR mutations ( exon 19 deletion , L858R , G719X , and L861Q ) who were treated with gefitinib in the NEJ002 study , which compared gefitinib with carboplatin-paclitaxel as the first-line therapy . In the NEJ002 study , 225 patients with EGFR mutations received gefitinib at any treatment line . The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that performance status , response to chemotherapy , response to gefitinib , and mutation types were significant prognostic factors . Overall survival ( OS ) was significantly shorter among patients with uncommon EGFR mutations ( G719X or L861Q ) compared with OS of those with common EGFR mutations ( 12 versus 28.4 months ; p = 0.002 ) . In the gefitinib group ( n = 114 ) , patients with uncommon EGFR mutations had a significantly shorter OS ( 11.9 versus 29.3 months ; p < 0.001 ) . By contrast , OS was similar between patients with uncommon mutations and those with common mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group ( n = 111 ; 22.8 versus 28 months ; p = 0.358 ) . The post-hoc analyses clearly demonstrated shorter survival for gefitinib-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with the survival of those with common mutations and suggest that the first-line chemotherapy may be relatively effective for non-small-cell lung cancer with uncommon EGFR mutations .',\n",
       " ' To compare refractive changes after corneal crosslinking with and without mechanical compression of the cornea . In a prospective , open , randomized case-control study conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology , Ume University Hospital , Sweden , sixty eyes of 43 patients with progressive keratoconus aged 18-28 years planned for corneal crosslinking and corresponding age - and sex-matched control subjects were included . The patients were randomized to conventional corneal crosslinking ( CXL ; n = 30 ) or corneal crosslinking with mechanical compression using a flat rigid contact lens sutured to the cornea during treatment ( CRXL ; n = 30 ) . Subjective refraction and ETDRS best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA ) , axial length measurement , keratometry and pachymetry were performed before and 1 and 6 months after treatment . The keratoconus patients had poorer BSCVA , higher refractive astigmatism and higher keratometry readings than the control subjects at baseline ( p < 0.01 ) . In the CXL group , BSCVA increased from 0.19 0.26 to 0.14 0.18 logMar ( p = 0.03 ) , and the spherical equivalent improved from -1.9 2.8 D to -1.4 2.4 D ( p = 0.03 ) . Maximum keratometry readings decreased after CXL from 53.1 4.9 D to 52.6 5.2 D ( p = 0.02 ) , and the axial length decreased in the CXL group , likely due to post-treatment corneal thinning ( p = 0.03 ) . In the CRXL group , all the above variables were unaltered ( p > 0.05 ) . At 6 months , the refractive results from CRXL did not surpass those of conventional CXL treatment . Rather , some variables indicated a slightly inferior effect . Possibly , stronger crosslinking would be necessary to stabilize the cornea in the flattened configuration achieved by the rigid contact lens .',\n",
       " ' Although coexisting obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) and Cheyne-Stokes respiration ( CSR ) occur frequently in patients with heart diseases , optimal treatment remains unclear . Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) effectively treats OSA and adaptive servo-ventilation ( ASV ) has been shown to improve CSR . We compared a new treatment algorithm combining automatic continuous positive airway pressure ( APAP ) and ASV ( anticyclic modulated ventilation , ACMV ) versus continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Thirty-nine patients ( 35 male , four female ; aged 65.59.7 years ; body mass index , 31.05.9 kg/m2 ) with underlying heart disease and coexisting OSA and CSR were enrolled . After diagnostic polysomnography ( PSG ) and CPAP titration , patients were randomized either to CPAP or to ACMV for four weeks of treatment in a crossover design . Total apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) was 49.018.8 / h at baseline , 12.314.6 / h with CPAP ( P < 0.001 vs baseline ) , and 3.75.6 / h with ACMV ( P < 0.001 vs. baseline and vs. CPAP ) . Obstructive AHI was 20.714.4 / h at baseline , 5.19.3 / h with CPAP ( P < 0.001 vs. baseline ) , and 0.40.4 / h with ACMV ( P < 0.001 vs. baseline and vs. CPAP ) . Central AHI was 28.313.4 / h at baseline , 7.29.7 / h with CPAP ( P < 0.001 vs baseline ) and 3.35.4 / h with ACMV ( P < 0.001 vs. baseline and vs. CPAP ) . Ejection fraction was increased significantly ( from 38.615.6 to 44.412.2 % ) only with ACMV . Subjective sleepiness significantly improved only with CPAP whereas objective sleep quality and treatment adherence were not different between both treatment modalities . ACMV is an effective treatment option in patients with coexisting OSA and CSR . It is superior to CPAP in reducing total AHI as well as obstructive and central AHI .',\n",
       " \" HER2 and TOP2A gene status are assessed for diagnostic and research purposes in breast cancer with fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . However , FISH probes do not target only the annotated gene , while chromosome 17 ( chr17 ) is among the most unstable chromosomes in breast cancer . Here we asked whether the status of specifically targeted genes on chr17 might help in refining prognosis of early high-risk breast cancer patients . Copy numbers ( CN ) for 14 genes on chr17 , 4 of which were within and 10 outside the core HER2 amplicon ( HER2 - and non-HER2-genes , respectively ) were assessed with qPCR in 485 paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in the frame of two randomized phase III trials . HER2-genes CN strongly correlated to each other ( Spearman 's rho > 0.6 ) and were concordant with FISH HER2 status ( Kappa 0.6697 for ERBB2 CN ) . TOP2A CN were not concordant with TOP2A FISH status ( Kappa 0.1154 ) . CN hierarchical clustering revealed distinct patterns of gains , losses and complex alterations in HER2 - and non-HER2-genes associated with IHC4 breast cancer subtypes . Upon multivariate analysis , non-HER2-gene gains independently predicted for shorter disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in patients with triple-negative cancer , as compared to luminal and HER2-positive tumors ( interaction p = 0.007 for DFS and p = 0.011 for OS ) . Similarly , non-HER2-gene gains were associated with worse prognosis in patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery as compared to modified radical mastectomy ( p = 0.004 for both DFS and OS ) . Non-HER2-gene losses were unfavorable prognosticators in patients with 1-3 metastatic nodes , as compared to those with 4 or more nodes ( p = 0.017 for DFS and p = 0.001 for OS ) . TOP2A FISH and qPCR may not identify the same pathology on chr17q . Non-HER2 chr17 CN patterns may further predict outcome in breast cancer patients with known favorable and unfavorable prognosis .\",\n",
       " ' Heart failure ( HF ) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) frequently coexist , with undefined prognostic and therapeutic implications . We investigated clinical profile and outcomes of patients with chronic HF and COPD , notably the efficacy and safety of ivabradine , a heart rate-reducing agent . 6505 ambulatory patients , in sinus rhythm , heart rate 70 bpm and stable systolic HF were randomised to placebo or ivabradine ( 2.5 to 7.5 mg bid ) . Multivariate Cox model analyses were performed to compare the COPD ( n = 730 ) and non-COPD subgroups , and the ivabradine and placebo treatment effects . COPD patients were older and had a poorer risk profile . Beta-blockers were prescribed to 69 % of COPD patients and 92 % of non-COPD patients . The primary endpoint ( PEP ) and its component , hospitalisation for worsening HF , were more frequent in COPD patients ( HRs f , 1.22 [ p = 0.006 ] ; and 1.34 [ p < 0.001 ] ) respectively , but relative risk was reduced similarly by ivabradine in both COPD ( 14 % , and 17 % ) and non-COPD ( 18 % and 27 % ) patients ( p interaction = 0.82 , and 0.53 , respectively ) . Similar effect was noted also for cardiovascular death . Adverse events were more common in COPD patients , but similar in treatment subgroups . Bradycardia occurred more frequently in ivabradine subgroups , with similar incidence in patients with or without COPD . The association of COPD and HF results in a worse prognosis , and COPD represents a barrier to optimisation of beta-blocker therapy . Ivabradine is similarly effective and safe in chronic HF patients with or without COPD , and can be safely combined with beta-blockers in COPD .',\n",
       " ' Although several eating disorder prevention programs reduce eating disorder risk factors and symptoms for female high school and college students , few efficacious prevention programs exist for female middle school students , despite the fact that body image and eating disturbances often emerge then . Two pilot trials evaluated a new dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program for middle school girls with body image concerns . Female middle school students with body dissatisfaction from two sites [ Study 1 : N = 81 , M age = 12.1 , standard deviation ( SD ) = 0.9 ; Study 2 : N = 52 , M age = 12.5 , SD = 0.8 ] were randomized to a dissonance intervention ( MS Body Project ) or educational brochure control ; Study 2 included a 3-month follow-up . Intervention participants showed significant post-test reductions in only one of the six variables with both Studies 1 and 2 ( i.e. , pressure to be thin and negative affect , respectively ) , though post-test effect sizes suggested medium reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms ( Study 1 : M d = .40 ; Study 2 : M d = .65 ) ; reductions at 3-month follow-up in Study 2 were not evident ( M d = .19 ) . Results suggest that this new middle school version of the Body Project is producing medium magnitude reductions in eating disorder risk factors at post-test but that effects are showing limited persistence . Continued refinement and evaluation of this intervention appears warranted to develop more effective prevention programs for this age group .',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral glutamine ( GL ) supplementation on gut permeability and endotoxemia ( surrogate end point ) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis . In a randomized controlled trial , patients were randomized to be given placebo or GL for 7 days . The primary outcome measures include the effect on gut permeability ( assessed by lactulose/mannitol excretion in urine and endotoxemia assessed by endotoxin core antibodies type IgG and IgM ( EndoCab IgG and IgM ) . The secondary outcome measures include infectious complications , mortality , total hospital/intensive care unit stay , C-reactive protein , and prealbumin levels . Patients were assigned to GL ( n = 41 ) and placebo ( n = 39 ) groups . There was no change in gut permeability after the intervention . However , the EndoCab IgM levels increased significantly ( 33 [ 4 , 175 ] to 40 [ 8 , 350 ] GMU/mL ; P = 0.0164 ) and the C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly ( 133 [ 1 , 287 ] to 88 [ 1 , 267 ] ng/mL ; P = 0.0236 ) in the GL group . No difference was observed in infectious complication , prealbumin value , hospital/intensive care unit stay , and mortality in both groups . No significant trend was identified for an effect of GL on gut permeability . Decreased inflammation and endotoxemia did not translate into reduced infectious complications in severe acute pancreatitis .

       " \" Tapentadol is an analgesic agent for treatment of acute and chronic pain that activates the - opioid receptor combined with inhibition of neuronal norepinephrine reuptake . Both mechanisms are implicated in activation of descending inhibitory pain pathways . In this study , we investigated the influence of tapentadol on conditioned pain modulation ( CPM , an experimental measure of endogenous pain inhibition that gates incoming pain signals as a consequence of a preceding tonic painful stimulus ) and offset analgesia ( OA , a test in which a disproportionally large amount of analgesia becomes apparent upon a slight decrease in noxious heat stimulation ) . Twenty-four patients with diabetic polyneuropathy ( DPN ) were randomized to receive daily treatment with tapentadol sustained-release ( SR ) [ average daily dose 433 ( 31 ) mg ] or placebo for 4 weeks . CPM and OA were measured before and on the last day of treatment . Before treatment , none of the patients had significant CPM or OA responses . At week 4 of treatment , CPM was significantly activated by tapentadol SR and coincided with significant analgesic responses . CPM increased from 9.1 ( 5.4 ) % ( baseline ) to 14.3 ( 7.2 ) % ( placebo ) and 24.2 ( 7.7 ) % ( tapentadol SR , P < 0.001 vs placebo ) ; relief of DPN pain was also greater in patients treated with tapentadol than placebo ( P = 0.028 ) . Neither placebo nor tapentadol SR treatment had an effect on the magnitude of the OA responses ( P = 0.78 ) . Tapentadol 's analgesic effect in chronic pain patients with DPN is dependent on activation of descending inhibitory pain pathways as observed by CPM responses .

       " ' To characterize the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and dose proportionality of mipomersen after single subcutaneous ( SC ) administration to Japanese healthy subjects ; and to compare the PK profiles of Japanese and Western subjects . 20 healthy first-generation Japanese male subjects were enrolled into one of three treatment cohorts ( 50 , 100 and 200 mg SC ) in a dose-escalation design . Within each cohort , subjects were randomized in a 4 : 1 ratio to receive mipomersen or placebo . Mipomersen was absorbed rapidly after SC administration ; median tmax varied between 2 and 3 hours . After reaching peak levels , plasma concentrations of mipomersen decayed multiphasically with an initial distribution t1/2 in several hours and a terminal t1/2 of 261 - 393 hours . Mean Cmax increased in a dose-linear manner while all mean AUC from time 0 to different cut points increased slightly more than dose proportionally . Although mean terminal t1/2 varied in the dose range tested , it did not show dose-dependence . The PK profiles of mipomersen in Japanese subjects are similar to those observed in Western subjects . A single SC dose of 50 mg , 100 mg and 200 mg mipomersen was well tolerated by male Japanese subjects . Single SC doses of 50 - 200 mg were safe and well tolerated when administered to Japanese subjects . Comparison of PK between Japanese and Western subjects does not support any need for dose adjustment in Japanese population in future clinical development .',\n",

A total of 276 patients were randomized into GTS ( n = 139 , one patch on days 1-4 ) or control group ( n = 137 , intravenous on day 1 and oral on days 2-4 ) . The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving complete response ( CR ) from chemotherapy initiation until 24 h after the final administration . Out of 234 patients ( 112 in GTS and 122 in control group ) included in the per protocol analysis , 97.9 % had gastrointestinal cancer and 76.9 % received 3-day chemotherapy . The GTS showed non-inferior efficacy achieving CR in 75.0 % of the patients ; 74.6 % of the patients in the control group achieved CR ( 95 % confidence interval -10.73 to 11.55 % ) . The CR rate did not change after subgroup analyses by sex , age , and chemotherapy naivety and analysis per day and overall days of treatment . The GTS group showed sustained CR from day 1 to day 4 . Patients ' satisfaction , assessed using Functional Living Index-Emesis ( FLI-E ) , showed no difference . Both treatments were well tolerated and safe . The GTS showed non-inferior efficacy to intravenous and oral granisetron . The safety , tolerability , and FLI-E scores of the GTS were comparable to those of control group . The GTS offers a convenient alternative option for relieving CINV in patients receiving MEC .\",\n",

There were 143 women randomised : 71 to the control group ( all analysed ) and 72 to the CrMS group ( 69 analysed ) . The adjusted hazard ratio for the influence of CrMS on TTP was 0.86 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.53 , 1.38 ] . Fecundability in cycles with intent to conceive was 31 % in controls and 36 % with CrMS ( P = 0.32 ) . By the first cycle , fecundability was 17 % in controls , and 4 % with CrMS ( P = 0.02 ) . No adverse events were reported . We found no significant impact of CrMS on TTP or fecundability , but fewer of the women receiving CrMS conceived by the first cycle .',\n",
       " \" Migraine is a highly disabling disease affecting a significant proportion of the Australian population . The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) C677T variant has been associated with increased levels of homocysteine and risk of migraine with aura ( MA ) . Folic acid ( FA ) , vitamin B6 , and B12 supplementation has been previously shown to reduce increased levels of homocysteine and decrease migraine symptoms . However , the influence of dietary folate intake on migraine has been unclear . The aim of the current study was to analyze the association of dietary folate intake in the form of dietary folate equivalent , FA , and total food folate ( TFF ) on migraine frequency , severity , and disability . A cohort of 141 adult females of Caucasian descent with MA was genotyped for the MTHFR C677T variant using restriction enzyme digestion . Dietary folate information was collected from all participants and analyzed using the `` FoodWorks '' 2009 package . Folate consumption was compared with migraine frequency , severity , and disability using linear regression . A significant inverse relation was observed between dietary folate equivalent ( R ( 2 ) = 0.201 , B = -0.002 , P = .045 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] [ -0.004 , -0.001 ] ) and FA ( R ( 2 ) = 0.255 , B = -0.005 , P = .036 , 95 % CI [ -0.009 , -0.002 ] ) consumption and migraine frequency . It was also observed that in individuals with the CC genotype for the MTHFR C677T variant , migraine frequency was significantly linked to FA consumption ( R ( 2 ) = 0.106 , B = -0.004 , P = .029 , 95 % CI [ -0.007 , -0.004 ] ) . The results from this study indicate that folate intake in the form of FA may influence migraine frequency in female MA sufferers .\",\n",

The analytic sample consisted of a random subcohort of 590 patients with type 2 diabetes without prevalent CKD at baseline , 124 of whom developed incident CKD during follow-up , and 520 additional patients with incident CKD outside the random subcohort . The association between serum intact fibroblast growth factor 23 and incident CKD , defined as the new onset of eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) that represented a 25 % decrease from baseline in an individual with eGFR60 ml/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) and no microalbuminuria ( < 30 mg/g creatinine ) at baseline , was tested . The mean baseline eGFR in the random subcohort was 90.922.7 ml/min per 1.73 m ( 2 ) . During a median follow-up of 4.7 years , there was a total of 644 patients with incident CKD .

Higher baseline fibroblast growth factor 23 levels were associated with higher risk of incident CKD in unadjusted and demographics-adjusted models , but the effect was attenuated after additional adjustment for clinical risk factors and baseline eGFR ( hazard ratio per SD of natural log fibroblast growth factor 23 , 1.09 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.94 to 1.27 ) , which was the strongest predictor of incident CKD . Consistent with the results of primary analyses , baseline fibroblast growth factor 23 was not associated with eGFR slope .

The PLCO was conducted from 1993 to 2011 at 10 US institutions . A total of 154,897 healthy men and women ages 55-74 years were randomized . Intervention arm participants were invited to receive gender-appropriate screening exams for prostate , lung , colorectal and ovarian cancer . Using intervention-arm data ( 73,036 participants ) , non-compliance percentages for 13 covariates were calculated , as were unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) , and 95 % confidence intervals . Covariates included demographic factors as well as factors specific to PLCO ( e.g. , method of consent , distance from screening center ) . The rate of non-compliance was 11 % overall but varied by screening center . Significant associations were observed for most covariates but indicated modest increases or decreases in odds . An exception was the use of a two-step consent process ( consented intervention arm participants for exams after randomization ) relative to a one-step process ( consented all participants prior to randomization ) ( OR : 2.2 , 95 % CI : 2.0-2 .5 ) . Non-compliance percentages increased with further distance from screening centers , but ORs were not significantly different from 1 . Many factors modestly influenced compliance .

The training was performed for 60-minute sessions in a heated pool ( 32C ) , three times a week for 12 weeks . The HEx protocol consisted of callisthenic exercises and walking inside the pool . The control group was asked to maintain habitual activities . The main outcome measure was change in mean 24-hour ambulatory BP ( ABPM ) . 32 patients ( HEx n = 16 ; control n = 16 ) were randomized ; none were lost to follow-up . Office BPs decreased significantly after heated water exercise ( 36/12 mmHg ) . HEx decreased 24-hour systolic ( from 13723 to 12012 mmHg , p = 0.001 ) and diastolic BPs ( from 8113 to 7210 mmHg , p = 0.009 ) ; daytime systolic ( from 14124 to 12013 mmHg , p < 0.0001 ) and diastolic BPs ( from 8414 to 7311 mmHg , p = 0.003 ) ; and nighttime systolic ( from 12922 to 11412 mmHg , p = 0.006 ) and diastolic BPs ( from 7411 to 6610 mmHg , p < 0.0001 ) . The control group after 12 weeks significantly increased in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BPs , and daytime and nighttime diastolic BPs . HEx reduced office BPs and 24-hour ABPM levels in resistant hypertensive patients . These effects suggest that HEx may be a potential new therapeutic approach in these patients .',\n",
       " ' Botulinum neurotoxin type A trials in aesthetic indications have used differing efficacy parameters and responder definitions . To analyze the treatment efficacy and duration of incobotulinumtoxinA for glabellar frown lines using pooled data from 2 large , Phase 3 , placebo-controlled trials , and end points similar to those used in previous botulinum neurotoxin type A studies . IncobotulinumtoxinA and placebo groups comprised 366 and 181 subjects , respectively . The efficacy of a single 20-U treatment of incobotulinumtoxinA or placebo was evaluated by investigator-assessed and subject-assessed responder rates ( 1-point improvement from baseline ) , mean score , and mean change from the baseline glabellar frown line severity score . At all follow-up visits , responder rates and mean change from the baseline score ( investigator-assessed and subject-assessed ) were significantly greater for incobotulinumtoxinA versus placebo ( p < .0001 ) . The maximum investigator-assessed responder rate ( 93.1 % ) was achieved at Day 30 after treatment , when the mean improvement on the 4-point facial wrinkle scale peaked at 1.88 . Treatment effect declined over time but the investigator-assessed responder rate was 45.7 % at the end of the study . Superiority of incobotulinumtoxinA over placebo for treating glabellar frown lines was confirmed . IncobotulinumtoxinA achieved a maximum responder rate of 93.1 % and a long duration of treatment effect : 45.7 % of subjects showed efficacy at 120 days .',\n",
       " \" To investigate whether standardised cigarette packaging increases the time spent looking at health warnings , regardless of the format of those warnings . A factorial ( two pack styles x three warning types ) within-subject experiment , with participants randomised to different orders of conditions , completed at a university in London , UK . Mock-ups of cigarette packets were presented to participants with their branded portion in either standardised ( plain ) or manufacturer-designed ( branded ) format . Health warnings were present on all packets , representing all three types currently in use in the UK : black & white text , colour text , or colour images with accompanying text . Gaze position was recorded using a specialised eye tracker , providing the main outcome measure , which was the mean proportion of a five-second viewing period spent gazing at the warning-label region of the packet . An opportunity sample of 30 ( six male , mean age = 23 ) young adults met the following inclusion criteria : 1 ) not currently a smoker ; 2 ) < 100 lifetime cigarettes smoked ; 3 ) gaze position successfully tracked for > 50 % viewing time . These participants spent a greater proportion of the available time gazing at the warning-label region when the branded section of the pack was standardised ( following current Australian guidelines ) rather than containing the manufacturer 's preferred design ( mean difference in proportions = 0.078 , 95 % confidence interval 0.049 to 0.106 , p < 0.001 ) . There was no evidence that this effect varied based on the type of warning label ( black & white text vs. colour text vs. colour image & text ; interaction p = 0.295 ) . During incidental viewing of cigarette packets , young adult never-smokers are likely to spend more time looking at health warnings if manufacturers are compelled to use standardised packaging , regardless of the warning design .\",\n",
       " ' To provide the 4-week prevalence estimates of mental disorders in cancer populations . We enrolled adult patients with cancer from in - and outpatient care facilities , using a proportional stratified random sample based on the nationwide cancer incidence in Germany . Patients who scored 9 or above on the Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) were administered to the standardized computer-assisted Composite International Diagnostic Interview for mental disorders adapted for cancer patients ( CIDI-O ) . A random sample of those with a PHQ-9 score that was less than 9 were selected for a CIDI-O . A total of 5,889 patients were identified , which led to 4,020 participants ( a 68.3 % response rate ) ; of those , 2,141 patients were interviewed . The 4-week total prevalence for any mental disorder was 31.8 % ( 95 % CI , 29.8 % to 33.8 % ) ; this included any anxiety disorder ( 11.5 % ; 95 % CI , 10.2 % to 12.9 % ) , any adjustment disorder ( 11.1 % ; 95 % CI , 9.7 % to 12.4 % ) , any mood disorder ( 6.5 % ; 95 % CI , 5.5 % to 7.5 % ) , any somatoform/conversion disorder ( 5.3 % ; 95 % CI , 4.3 % to 6.2 % ) , nicotine dependence ( 4.5 % ; 95 % CI , 3.6 % to 5.4 % ) , alcohol abuse/dependence ( 0.3 % ; 95 % CI , 0.1 % to 0.6 % ) , any mental disorder resulting from general medical condition ( 2.3 % ; 95 % CI , 1.7 % to 2.9 % ) , and any eating disorder ( 0 % ) . The highest prevalence for any mental disorder was found in patients with breast cancer ( 41.6 % ; 95 % CI , 36.8 % to 46.4 % ) , followed by patients with head and neck cancer ( 40.8 % ; 95 % CI , 28.5 % to 53.0 % ) . The lowest prevalence was found in patients with pancreatic cancer ( 20.3 % ; 95 % CI , 8.9 % to 31.6 % ) and stomach/esophagus cancers ( 21.2 % ; 95 % CI , 12.8 % to 29.6 % ) .

       " ' Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome ( BHD ) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterised by the occurrence of benign , mostly facial , skin tumours called fibrofolliculomas , multiple lung cysts , spontaneous pneumothorax and an increased renal cancer risk . Current treatments for fibrofolliculomas have high rates of recurrence and carry a risk of complications . It would be desirable to have a treatment that could prevent fibrofolliculomas from growing . Animal models of BHD have previously shown deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) . Topical use of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is an effective treatment for the skin tumours ( angiofibromas ) in tuberous sclerosis complex , which is also characterised by mTOR deregulation . In this study we aimed to determine if topical rapamycin is also an effective treatment for fibrofolliculomas in BHD. . We performed a double blinded , randomised , facial left-right controlled trial of topical rapamycin 0.1 % versus placebo in 19 BHD patients . Trial duration was 6 months . The primary outcome was cosmetic improvement as measured by doctors and patients . Changes in fibrofolliculoma number and size were also measured , as was occurrence of side effects . No change in cosmetic status of fibrofolliculomas was reported in the majority of cases for the rapamycin treated ( 79 % by doctors , 53 % by patients ) as well as the placebo treated facial sides ( both 74 % ) . No significant differences between rapamycin and placebo treated facial halves were observed ( p = 1.000 for doctors opinion , p = 0.344 for patients opinion ) . No significant difference in fibrofolliculoma number or change in size of the fibrofolliculomas was seen after 6 months . Side effects occurred more often after rapamycin treatment ( 68 % of patients ) than after placebo ( 58 % of patients ; p = 0.625 ) . A burning sensation , erythema , itching and dryness were most frequently reported . This study provides no evidence that treatment of fibrofolliculomas with topical rapamycin in BHD results in cosmetic improvement . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00928798 .',\n",
       " \" Accurately estimating the period of time that individuals are exposed to online intervention content is important for understanding program engagement . This can be calculated from time-stamped data reflecting navigation to and from individual webpages . Prolonged periods of inactivity are commonly handled with a time-out feature and assigned a prespecified exposure duration . Unfortunately , this practice can lead to biased results describing program exposure . The aim of the study was to describe how multiple imputations can be used to better account for the time spent viewing webpages that result in a prolonged period of inactivity or a time-out . To illustrate this method , we present data on time-outs collected from the Q ( 2 ) randomized smoking cessation trial . For this analysis , we evaluate the effects on intervention exposure of receiving content written in a prescriptive versus motivational tone . Using multiple imputations , we created five complete datasets in which the time spent viewing webpages that resulted in a time-out were replaced with values estimated with imputation models . We calculated standard errors using Rubin 's formulas to account for the variability due to the imputations . We also illustrate how current methods of accounting for time-outs ( excluding timed-out page views or assigning an arbitrary viewing time ) can influence conclusions about participant engagement . A total of 63.00 % ( 1175/1865 ) of participants accessed the online intervention in the Q ( 2 ) trial . Of the 6592 unique page views , 683 ( 10.36 % , 683/6592 ) resulted in a time-out . The median time spent viewing webpages that did not result in a time-out was 1.07 minutes . Assuming participants did not spend any time viewing a webpage that resulted in a time-out , no difference between the two message tones was observed ( ratio of mean time online : 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.75-1 .02 ) . Assigning 30 minutes of viewing time to all page views that resulted in a time-out concludes that participants who received content in a motivational tone spent less time viewing content ( ratio of mean time online : 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.77-0 .98 ) than those participants who received content in a prescriptive tone . Using multiple imputations to account for time-outs concludes that there is no difference in participant engagement between the two message tones ( ratio of mean time online : 0.87 ; 95 % CI 0.75-1 .01 ) . The analytic technique chosen can significantly affect conclusions about online intervention engagement . We propose a standardized methodology in which time spent viewing webpages that result in a time-out is treated as missing information and corrected with multiple imputations .

A randomized controlled trial . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients were randomized into two groups according pleural drain site : II group ( n = 27 ) - pleural drain in intercostal space ; SI group ( n = 29 ) - pleural drain in the subxyphoid region . Spirometry values ( Forced Vital Capacity - and Forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) were obtained on preoperative and 1 , 3 and 5 postoperative days . Chest x-ray from preoperative until postoperative day 5 ( POD5 ) was performed for monitoring respiratory events , such as atelectasis and pleural effusion . Pulmonary shunt fraction and pain score was evaluate preoperatively and on postoperative day 1 . In both groups there was a significant decrease of the spirometry values ( Forced Vital Capacity and Forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) until POD5 ( P < 0.05 ) . However , when compared , SI group presented less decrease in these parameters ( P < 0.05 ) . Pulmonary shunt fraction was significantly lower in SI group ( P < 0.05 ) . Respiratory events , pain score , orotracheal intubation time and postoperative length of hospital stay were lower in the SI group ( P < 0.05 ) . Subxyphoid pleural drainage in severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients determined better preservation and recovery of pulmonary capacity and volumes with lower pulmonary shunt fraction and better clinical outcomes on early postoperative off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting .',\n",
       " ' Little is known about the effects of natural mineral water on constipation in adults . We assessed the effect of a magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral water ( Hpar ; Nestl Waters , Issy-les-Moulineaux , France ) on gastrointestinal transit in constipated women . We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hpar in outpatients with functional constipation ( based on the Rome III criteria ) . The study included 244 female patients , age 18 to 60 years , identified by 62 general practitioners throughout France . After a washout period , subjects drank 1.5 L natural low-mineral water daily ( control , n = 77 ) , 0.5 L Hpar and 1 L natural low-mineral water daily ( Hpar 0.5 group , n = 85 ) , or 1 L Hpar and 0.5 L natural low-mineral water daily ( Hpar 1 group , n = 82 ) for 4 weeks . We collected information on the number and types of stools , abdominal pain , rescue medications , adverse events , and volume of water consumed . We observed no significant effect at week 1 . At week 2 , constipation was reduced in 21.1 % of patients in the control group , in 30.9 % in the Hpar 0.5 group ( P = .099 vs controls ) , and in 37.5 % in the Hpar 1 group ( P = .013 vs controls ) . The Hpar 1 group also had a decreased number of hard or lumpy stools ( Bristol scale , P = .030 vs baseline ) and a substantial decrease in the use of rescue medication ( P = .034 vs controls ) . Patient responses correlated with magnesium sulfate concentrations . Safety was very good ; there were no serious adverse events among patients who drank Hpar . In a controlled trial , daily consumption of 1 L Hpar reduced constipation and hard or lumpy stools in a greater percentage of women with functional constipation than natural low-mineral water , as early as the second week of treatment .',\n",

Ophthalmology Department , Mlndal Hospital , Gothenburg , and St. Erik Eye Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden . Randomized double-masked clinical trial . Patients at low risk for postoperative inflammation were recruited and randomized to the nepafenac group or to the control group . Postoperative swelling of the macula was assessed with ocular coherence tomography . Laser flare intensity , corrected distance visual acuity , ocular discomfort , and visual complaints were also recorded . The analysis of intent-to-treat population comprised 75 patients in the nepafenac group and 77 patients in the control group . Compared with the control regimen , add-on nepafenac resulted in statistically significant reductions in the following parameters : change in macular volume at 3 weeks and 6 weeks ( P < .001 ) , proportion of patients with more than 10 m of swelling in the central macula at 3 weeks ( P < .0001 ) and 6 weeks ( P = .02 ) , mean laser flare intensity at 1 day ( P = .029 ) , pain during the first 24 hours postoperatively ( P < .0001 ) , and ocular discomfort and photophobia during the first 3 postoperative weeks ( P = .0058 and P = .0052 , respectively ) .

       " ' Cutaneous telangiectases are a characteristic and psychologically distressing feature of SSc . Our aim was to assess the efficacy of two light-based treatments : pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) and intense pulsed light ( IPL ) . Nineteen patients with facial or upper limb telangiectases underwent three treatments with PDL and IPL ( randomly assigned to left - and right-sided lesions ) . Outcome measures were clinical photography ( assessed by two clinicians ) , dermoscopy ( assessed by two observers ) , laser Doppler imaging ( LDI ) and observer and patient opinion , including patient self-assessment psychological questionnaires [ Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) , Adapted Satisfaction with Appearance Scale ( ASWAP ) ] . Comparison between 16-week follow-up and baseline photography scores ( from -2 to +2 on a Likert scale , with > 0 being improvement ) were a mean score for PDL of 1.7 ( 95 % CI 1.4 , 2.0 ) and for IPL 1.4 ( 0.9 , 1.8 ) , with a mean difference between PDL and IPL of -0.3 ( -0.5 , -0.1 ) ( P = 0.01 ) . Dermoscopy scores also improved with both therapies : PDL 1.3 ( 1.1 , 1.5 ) and IPL 0.8 ( 0.5 , 1.1 ) , again greater with PDL ( P = 0.01 ) . LDI showed decreases in blood flow at 16 weeks , indicating a response to both therapies . All patients reported benefit from treatment ( more preferred PDL at 16 weeks ) . Psychological questionnaires also indicated improvement after therapy with mean change in ASWAP of -13.9 ( 95 % CI -20.5 , -7.4 ) . No side effects were reported for IPL ; PDL caused transient bruising in most cases . Both PDL and IPL are effective treatments for SSc-related telangiectases . Outcome measures indicate that PDL has better outcomes in terms of appearance , although IPL had fewer side effects .',\n",

For this prospective , multicenter , randomized , double-blind and placebo-controlled trial , a total of 300 HFMD outpatients from 3 class 3A hospitals from July 2011 to June 2013 were divided into treatment ( ribavirin aerosol ) and control ( placebo ) groups ( n = 150 each ) . The age range was 6 months to 6 years . The proportion of male and female was 1.5 : 1 . Temperature , herpes of mouth and skin rash were observed before and after treatments . Before treatment and 6-7 days after , their specimens of throat swab were collected and the levels of EV71 and CA16 detected with reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR . The software SAS 9.2 was used for statistic data analyses . Before treatment , no significant statistical difference existed in parameters between treatment and control groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . After treatment , the degree of herpes of mouth and papulovesicle of skin in treatment group was better than that in control group ( 100.0 % ( 147/147 ) vs 83.9 % ( 120/143 ) , ( 2 ) = 109.21 , P < 0.01 ) ; ( 100.0 % ( 147/147 ) vs 95.9 % ( 139/145 ) , ( 2 ) = 6.38 , P < 0.05 ) . The virus negative conversion rates had significant inter-group difference ( 80.0 % ( 102/110 ) vs 41.8 % ( 41/98 ) , ( 2 ) = 37.06 , P < 0.01 ) . The temperature , compliance and differences were not significant ( all P > 0.05 ) . The effective rate of comprehensive efficacy in treatment group was higher than that in control group ( 93.9 % ( 122/130 ) vs 52.0 % ( 64/123 ) , ( 2 ) = 111.08 , P < 0.01 ) . No obvious adverse drug reaction was observed . Ribavirin aerosol has multiple advantages of lower dose , quicker onset , higher local concentration , better clinical efficacy and fewer side-effects . Its therapeutic effect for local lesion is better than that for systemic lesion . Thus it may shorten the duration of oropharyngeal and skin lesions and lower the number and time of viral release .',\n",

We aimed to assess the effect of a cART regimen intensified with raltegravir and maraviroc , compared with standard triple-drug cART , on HIV-DNA load . In this randomised , open-label , phase 3 trial , we recruited patients from hospitals across France . Inclusion criteria were primary HIV-1 infection ( an incomplete HIV-1 western blot and detectable plasma HIV-RNA ) , with either symptoms or a CD4 + cell count below 500 cells per L. Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to an intensive , five-drug cART regimen ( raltegravir 400 mg and maraviroc 150 mg twice daily , and a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 g plus emtricitabine 200 g , darunavir 800 g , and ritonavir 100 g once daily ) or a standard triple-drug cART regimen ( tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 g plus emtricitabine 200 g , darunavir 800 g , and ritonavir 100 g once daily ) using a predefined randomised list generated by randomly selected variable block sizes . The primary endpoint was the median number of HIV-DNA copies per 10 ( 6 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) at month 24 , analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population , defined as all patients who started their assigned treatment . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01033760 . Between April 26 , 2010 , and July 13 , 2011 , 110 patients were enrolled , of whom 92 were randomly assigned and 90 started treatment ( 45 in each treatment group ) . Six ( 13 % ) patients in the intensive cART group and two ( 4 % ) in the standard cART group discontinued before month 24 . At month 24 , HIV-DNA loads were similar between groups ( 235 [ IQR 205-250 ] log per 10 ( 6 ) PBMC in the intensive cART group vs 225 [ 171-255 ] in the standard cART group ; p = 021 ) . Eight grade 3-4 clinical adverse events were reported in seven patients in the intensive cART group and seven grade 3-4 clinical adverse events were reported in seven patients in the standard cART group . Three serious clinical adverse events occurred : two ( pancreatitis and lipodystrophy ) in the standard cART group , which were regarded as treatment related , and one event ( suicide attempt ) in the intensive cART group that was unrelated to treatment . After 24 months , cART intensified with raltegravir and maraviroc did not have a greater effect on HIV blood reservoirs than did standard cART . These results should help to design future trials of treatments aiming to decrease the HIV reservoir in patients with primary HIV-1 infection .

       " ' To test the effects of pregabalin on the induction of neurogenic claudication . This study was a randomized , double-blind , active placebo-controlled , 2-period , crossover trial . Twenty-nine subjects were randomized to receive pregabalin followed by active placebo ( i.e. , diphenhydramine ) or active placebo followed by pregabalin . Each treatment period lasted 10 days , including a 2-step titration . Periods were separated by a 10-day washout period , including a 3-day taper phase after the first period . The primary outcome variable was the time to first moderate pain symptom ( Numeric Rating Scale score 4 ) during a 15-minute treadmill test ( Tfirst ) . Secondary outcome measures included pain intensity at rest , pain intensity at the end of the treadmill test , distance walked , and validated self-report measures of pain and functional limitation including the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire , modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form , Oswestry Disability Index , and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire . No significant difference was found between pregabalin and active placebo for the time to first moderate pain symptom ( difference in median Tfirst = -1.08 [ 95 % confidence interval -2.25 to 0.08 ] , p = 0.61 ) . In addition , none of the secondary outcome measures of pain or functional limitation were significantly improved by pregabalin compared with active placebo . Pregabalin was not more effective than active placebo in reducing painful symptoms or functional limitations in patients with neurogenic claudication associated with lumbar spinal stenosis . This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with neurogenic claudication , compared with diphenhydramine , pregabalin does not increase the time to moderate pain during a treadmill test .',\n",
       " ' A phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate the bioavailability and food effect of a new veliparib formulation in subjects with solid tumors . Subjects ( planned : Stage I , N = 20 ; Stage II , N = 16 ) received four regimens of a single oral dose of veliparib utilizing a group-sequential design . Subjects were administered single doses of 40 mg veliparib supplied as four 10 mg current formulation , four 10 mg new formulation and one 40 mg new formulation under fasting conditions and under non-fasting conditions . Serial blood samples were collected for the determination of veliparib pharmacokinetics . At the end of Stage I , the relative bioavailability between each pair of regimens was assessed by a two one-sided tests procedure from the analyses of the natural logarithms of C ( max ) and AUC . A 92.7 % confidence interval within the 0.80-1 .25 range between each regimen pair determined bioequivalence . Four 10 mg current formulation capsules , four 10 mg new formulation and one 40 mg new formulation were bioequivalent with respect to C ( max ) and AUC under fasting conditions . The administration of a high-fat meal did not have a significant effect on AUC and only caused a slight decrease in veliparib C ( max ) ( 17 % ) and a delay of approximately 1 h in T ( max ) . The 40 mg new capsule was bioequivalent to currently used formulation . Food had no effect on the extent of veliparib absorption and only a small ( 17 % ) decrease in peak exposure of veliparib .',\n",

We evaluated if RASI with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) increased mortality in patients with mild to moderate AS . All patients ( n = 1873 ) from the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis study : asymptomatic patients with AS and preserved left ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction were included . Risks of sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) , cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality according to RASI treatment were analyzed by multivariable time-varying Cox models and propensity score matched analyses . 769 ( 41 % ) patients received RASI . During a median follow-up of 4.3 0.9 years , 678 patients were categorized as having severe AS , 545 underwent aortic valve replacement , 40 SCDs , 103 cardiovascular and 205 all-cause deaths occurred . RASI was not associated with SCD ( HR : 1.19 [ 95 % CI : 0.50-2 .83 ] , p = 0.694 ) , cardiovascular ( HR : 1.05 [ 95 % CI : 0.62-1 .77 ] , p = 0.854 ) or all-cause mortality ( HR : 0.81 [ 95 % CI : 0.55-1 .20 ] , p = 0.281 ) . This was confirmed in propensity matched analysis ( all p > 0.05 ) . In separate analyses , RASI was associated with larger reduction in systolic blood pressure ( p = 0.001 ) and less progression of LV mass ( p = 0.040 ) . RASI was not associated with SCD , cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in asymptomatic AS patients .

       " ' Exercise capacity is a strong predictor of survival in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Exercise capacity improves after cardiac rehabilitation exercise training , but previous studies have demonstrated a decline in peak oxygen uptake after ending a formal rehabilitation program . There is a lack of knowledge on how long-term exercise adherence can be achieved in CAD patients . We therefore assessed if a 12-month maintenance program following cardiac rehabilitation would lead to increased adherence to exercise and increased exercise capacity compared to usual care . Two-centre , open , parallel randomized controlled trial with 12 months follow-up comparing usual care to a maintenance program . The maintenance program consisted of one monthly supervised high intensity interval training session , a written exercise program and exercise diary , and a maximum exercise test every third month during follow-up . Forty-nine patients ( 15 women ) on optimal medical treatment were included following discharge from cardiac rehabilitation . The primary endpoint was change in peak oxygen uptake at follow-up ; secondary endpoints were physical activity level , quality of life and blood markers of cardiovascular risk . There was no change in peak oxygen uptake from baseline to follow-up in either group ( intervention group 27.9 ( 4.7 ) to 28.8 ( 5.6 ) mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) , control group 32.0 ( 6.2 ) to 32.8 ( 5.8 ) mLkg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) , with no between-group difference , p = 0.22 ) . Quality of life and blood biomarkers remained essentially unchanged , and both self-reported and measured physical activity levels were similar between groups after 12 months . A maintenance exercise program for 12 months did not improve adherence to exercise or peak oxygen uptake in CAD patients after discharge from cardiac rehabilitation compared to usual care . This suggests that infrequent supervised high intensity interval training sessions are inadequate to improve peak oxygen uptake in this patient group . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01246570 .',\n",

We enrolled 1260 patients , with 630 assigned to EGDT and 630 to usual care . By 90 days , 184 of 623 patients ( 29.5 % ) in the EGDT group and 181 of 620 patients ( 29.2 % ) in the usual-care group had died ( relative risk in the EGDT group , 1.01 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.85 to 1.20 ; P = 0.90 ) , for an absolute risk reduction in the EGDT group of -0.3 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -5.4 to 4.7 ) . Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group was indicated by increased use of intravenous fluids , vasoactive drugs , and red-cell transfusions and reflected by significantly worse organ-failure scores , more days receiving advanced cardiovascular support , and longer stays in the intensive care unit . There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes , including health-related quality of life , or in rates of serious adverse events . On average , EGDT increased costs , and the probability that it was cost-effective was below 20 % . In patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation , hemodynamic management according to a strict EGDT protocol did not lead to an improvement in outcome .

       " ' To identify characteristics of hemodialysis patients most likely to experience difficulty adhering to sodium restrictions associated with their dietary regimen . Secondary analysis using baseline data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial examining the effects of a technology-supported behavioral intervention on dietary sodium intake in hemodialysis patients . Thirteen dialysis centers in southwestern Pennsylvania . We included 122 participants ( 61 % women ; 48 % African American ) aged 61 14 years undergoing maintenance , intermittent hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease . Normalized dietary sodium intake , adjusted interdialytic weight gain , perceived problems , and self-efficacy for restricting dietary sodium . Younger participants were more likely to report problems managing their hemodialysis diet and low self-efficacy for restricting sodium intake . Consistent with these findings , younger participants had a higher median sodium intake and higher average adjusted interdialytic weight gain . Females reported more problems managing their diet . Race , time on dialysis , and perceived income adequacy did not seem to influence outcome measures . Our findings suggest that patients who are younger and female encounter more difficulty adhering to the hemodialysis regimen . Hence , there may be a need to individualize counseling and interventions for these individuals . Further investigation is needed to understand the independent effects of age and gender on adherence to hemodialysis dietary recommendations and perceived self-efficacy .',\n",
       " ' Ventricular and supraventricular premature complexes ( PC ) are frequent and usually symptomatic . According to a previous study , magnesium pidolate ( MgP ) administration to symptomatic patients can improve the PC density and symptoms . To assess the late follow-up of that clinical intervention in patients treated with MgP or placebo . In the first phase of the study , 90 symptomatic and consecutive patients with PC were randomized ( double-blind ) to receive either MgP or placebo for 30 days . Monthly follow-up visits were conducted for 15 months to assess symptoms and control electrolytes . 24-hour Holter was performed twice , regardless of symptoms , or whenever symptoms were present . In the second phase of the study , relapsing patients , who had received MgP or placebo ( crossing-over ) in the first phase , were treated with MgP according to the same protocol . Of the 45 patients initially treated with MgP , 17 ( 37.8 % ) relapsed during the 15-month follow-up , and the relapse time varied . Relapsing patients treated again had a statistically significant reduction in the PC density of 138.25 / hour ( p < 0.001 ) . The crossing-over patients reduced it by 247/hour ( p < 0.001 ) . Patients who did not relapse , had a low PC frequency ( 3 PC/hour ) . Retreated patients had a 76.5 % improvement in symptom , and crossing-over patients , 71.4 % . Some patients on MgP had relapse of symptoms and PC , indicating that MgP is neither a definitive nor a curative treatment for late follow-up . However , improvement in the PC frequency and symptoms was observed in the second phase of treatment , similar to the response in the first phase of treatment .',\n",

This was a single center , randomized , open label , examiner-blind , 2-treatment , parallel group study . Study participants who met the entrance criteria were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of the two toothbrush groups . Study participants brushed with their assigned toothbrush and a marketed fluoride dentifrice for 2 minutes twice daily at home for 6 weeks . Gingivitis and plaque were evaluated at baseline and Week 6 . Gingivitis was assessed using the Modified Gingival Index ( MGI ) and Gingival Bleeding Index ( GBI ) and plaque was assessed using the Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index ( RMNPI ) . Data was analyzed using the ANCOVA with baseline as the covariate . In total , 130 study participants were randomized to treatment resulting in 64 study participants per group completing the study . Both brushes produced statistically significant ( P < 0.001 ) reductions in gingivitis and plaque measures relative to baseline . The oscillating-rotating , brush with the novel brush head demonstrated statistically significantly ( P < 0.05 ) greater reductions in all gingivitis measures , as well as whole mouth and interproximal plaque measures , compared to the sonic toothbrush . The benefit for the oscillating - rotating brush over the sonic brush was 21.3 % for gingivitis , 35.7 % for gingival bleeding , 34.7 % for number of bleeding sites , 17.4 % for whole mouth plaque , and 21.2 % for interproximal plaque . There were no adverse events reported or observed for either brush .',\n",
       " ' Value of information analysis has been proposed as an alternative to the standard hypothesis testing approach , which is based on type I and type II errors , in determining sample sizes for randomized clinical trials . However , in addition to sample size calculation , value of information analysis can optimize other aspects of research design such as possible comparator arms and alternative follow-up times , by considering trial designs that maximize the expected net benefit of research , which is the difference between the expected cost of the trial and the expected value of additional information . To apply value of information methods to the results of a pilot study on catheter securement devices to determine the optimal design of a future larger clinical trial . An economic evaluation was performed using data from a multi-arm randomized controlled pilot study comparing the efficacy of four types of catheter securement devices : standard polyurethane , tissue adhesive , bordered polyurethane and sutureless securement device . Probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation was used to characterize uncertainty surrounding the study results and to calculate the expected value of additional information . To guide the optimal future trial design , the expected costs and benefits of the alternative trial designs were estimated and compared . Analysis of the value of further information indicated that a randomized controlled trial on catheter securement devices is potentially worthwhile . Among the possible designs for the future trial , a four-arm study with 220 patients/arm would provide the highest expected net benefit corresponding to 130 % return-on-investment . The initially considered design of 388 patients/arm , based on hypothesis testing calculations , would provide lower net benefit with return-on-investment of 79 % . Cost-effectiveness and value of information analyses were based on the data from a single pilot trial which might affect the accuracy of our uncertainty estimation . Another limitation was that different follow-up durations for the larger trial were not evaluated . The value of information approach allows efficient trial design by maximizing the expected net benefit of additional research . This approach should be considered early in the design of randomized clinical trials .',\n",
       " ' To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two different tooth replacement strategies for partially dentate older patients , namely partial removable dental prostheses ( RDP ) and functionally orientated treatment based on the shortened dental arch concept ( SDA ) . Ninety-two partially dentate older patients completed a randomized controlled clinical trial . Patients were randomly allocated to two treatment groups : the RDP group and the SDA group . Treatment effect was measured using impact on oral health-related quality of life ( OHrQOL ) , and the costs involved in providing and maintaining care were recorded for all patients . Patients were followed for 12 months after treatment intervention . All treatment was provided by a single operator . The total cost of achieving the minimally important clinical difference ( MID ) in OHrQOL for an average patient in the RDP group was 464.64 . For the SDA group , the cost of achieving the MID for an average patient was 252.00 . The cost-effectiveness ratio was therefore 1:1.84 in favour of SDA treatment . With an increasingly ageing population , many patients will continue to benefit from removable prostheses to replace their missing natural teeth . From a purely economic standpoint , the results from this analysis suggest that the treatment of partially dentate older adults should be focused on functionally orientated treatment because it is simply more cost-effective .',\n",
       " ' Previous reports suggest that adherence to patching is a major issue in amblyopia treatment . We tested with an unmasked randomised controlled clinical trial whether an intense educational/motivational intervention improves adherence when a high-dose regime is prescribed . 62 children with newly diagnosed amblyopia were randomly allocated into two treatment arms with and without educational/motivational intervention material . Both were prescribed patching 10 h/day , 6 days/week for a fixed period of 12 weeks . The intervention arm received an educational/motivational intervention before patching which included information booklets , video , a cartoon story book , sticker charts and a dedicated session with a researcher . The control arm received the usual clinical information . The primary outcome measure was adherence measured using electronic occlusion dose monitors where a success/failure binary outcome was used to account for participants who dropped out of the study defined as patching > 4 h/day . Visual outcome , expressed as percentage visual deficit , was measured as secondary outcome . The intervention increased adherence success rate from 45.2 % in the control group to 80.6 % in the intervention group ( p = 0.0027 ) . However , visual outcome was not significantly better in the intervention group ( p = 0.190 ) . Our study shows that an intense educational/motivational intervention can improve adherence to patching to high prescribed doses although no significant improvement in visual outcome was observed .

To minimize adverse effects on glycemic control , prevention and management of general and oral complications in diabetic patients is essential . The purpose of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of a Lifestyle Change plus Dental Care ( LCDC ) program to improve glycemic and periodontal status in the elderly with type 2 diabetes . A quasi-experimental study was conducted in Health Centers 54 ( intervention ) and 59 ( control ) from October 2013 to January 2014.66 diabetic patients per health center were included . At baseline , the intervention group attended a 20 minute lifestyle and oral health education program , individual lifestyle counseling using motivational interviewing ( MI ) , application of self regulation manual , and individual oral hygiene instruction . The intervention group received booster education every visit by viewing a 15 minute educational video . The control group received a routine program . Participants were assessed at baseline and 3 month follow up for glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , periodontal status , knowledge , attitude and practice of oral health and diabetes mellitus . Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistic , Chi-square test , Fisher 's exact test , t-test , and multiple linear regression . After the 3 month follow up , a multiple linear regression analysis showed that the intervention group was significantly negatively correlated in both glycemic and periodontal status . Participants in the intervention group had significantly lower glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , plaque index score , gingival index score , pocket depth , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , and percentage of bleeding on probing ( BOP ) when compared to the control group .

A total of 73 patients who sought treatment at the menopause units of the authors ' gynecology and obstetrics clinics between of November 2003 and October 2004 complaining of vasomotor symptoms were included in the study prospectively . The cases were divided into two groups : Group I ( 37 patients ) was given 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2 mg dienogest , and Group II ( 36 patients ) was given 2 mg estradiol valerate and 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate . The groups ' results in months 0 and 6 were compared through the evaluation of vasomotor and psychological symptom levels . No significant difference was found between the groups when the initial levels of vasomotor and psychological symptom subtypes were compared ( p = 0.16 ) . It was observed that all the psychological symptoms decreased in the 6th month in the group using dienogest in comparison with the initial situation , and that psychological symptoms increased in the group using medroxyprogesterone acetate in the evaluation performed in the 6th month compared with the initial levels . It was also found out that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups when compared in terms of these symptoms ( p < 0.0001 ) . While the use of dienogest normalizes the general psychological situation and sleep , it was observed that the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) worsens the general psychological situation .\",\n",
       " ' Cross-sectional and retrospective studies have associated major depressive disorder with glial activation and injury as well as blood-brain barrier disruption , but these associations have not been assessed prospectively . Here , we aimed to determine the relationship between changes in depressive symptom severity and in blood levels of S-100 calcium-binding protein B ( S-100B ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , and interleukin-6 following an inflammatory challenge . Fifty unselected participants were recruited from a randomized , controlled trial comparing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures performed with versus without cardiopulmonary bypass for the risk of neurocognitive decline . Depressive symptom severity was measured at baseline , discharge , and six-month follow-up using the Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) . The primary outcome of the present biomarker study was acute change in depressive symptom severity , defined as the intra-subject difference between baseline and discharge BDI-II scores . Blood biomarker levels were determined at baseline and 2 days postoperative . Changes in S-100B levels correlated positively with acute changes in depressive symptom severity ( Spearman , 0.62 ; P = 0.0004 ) and accounted for about one-fourth of their observed variance ( R2 , 0.23 ; P = 0.0105 ) . This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for baseline S-100B levels , age , weight , body-mass index , or - blocker use , but not baseline BDI-II scores ( P = 0.064 ) . There was no statistically significant association between the primary outcome and baseline S-100B levels , baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 levels , or changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 levels . Among most participants , levels of all three biomarkers were normal at baseline and markedly elevated at 2 days postoperative . Acute changes in depressive symptom severity were specifically associated with incremental changes in S-100B blood levels , largely independent of covariates associated with either . These findings support the hypothesis that glial activation and injury and blood-brain barrier disruption can be mechanistically linked to acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms in some individuals .',\n",
       " ' We hypothesized that untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is associated with elevated ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) in subjects with high cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk despite medical management . Data from the baseline examination of the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment ( HeartBEAT ) study , a 4-site randomized controlled trial were analyzed . Individuals with moderate-severe OSA ( apnea hypopnea index , AHI = 15-50 ) and cardiovascular risk were recruited from cardiology practices . Those with hypertension were included . Intensive antihypertensive regimen ( IAR ) was defined as 3 antihypertensives including a diuretic . Definitions were : controlled BP ( BP < 130/80 ) , uncontrolled elevated BP ( BP 130/80 not on IAR ) and resistant elevated BP ( BP 130/80 mm Hg despite IAR ) . Associations of untreated severe OSA ( AHI 30 ) and uncontrolled and resistant elevated BP were evaluated using logistic regression analyses adjusted for age , sex , race , body mass index , smoking status , diabetes , and CVD . Among the 284 participants ( mean age 63.1 7.2 years , 23.6 % with severe OSA ) , 61.6 % had controlled BP , 28.5 % had uncontrolled elevated BP , and 9.9 % had resistant elevated BP . Among participants prescribed IAR , resistant elevated BP was more prevalent in those with severe compared to moderate OSA ( 58.3 % vs. 28.6 % , p = 0.01 ) . Participants with severe OSA had a 4-fold higher adjusted odds of resistant elevated BP ( OR 4.1 , 95 % CI : 1.7-10 .2 ) , a finding not reproduced in the absence of IAR use . Among patients with increased cardiovascular risk and moderate to severe OSA , untreated severe compared to moderate OSA was associated with elevated BP despite IAR suggesting untreated severe OSA contributes to poor BP control despite aggressive medication use .

       " ' The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination of autologous transplantation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) - mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMNCs ) and Panax notoginseng saponins ( PNS ) in the treatment of unreconstructable critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) . We performed an open-label , parallel-group , single-center , randomized clinical trial in this study . A total of 52 patients were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups ( the PBMNC + PNS group and the PBMNC group ) in a 1:1 ratio . Evaluation variables , including changes in the ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) of ischemic limbs , ulcer area , severity of rest pain , transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( T ( C ) PO2 ) , and 6-min walk distance from baseline to week 8 and 16 , as well as angiographic scores for new collateral vessel formation at week 16 , were used to compare the benefits of these 2 treatment approaches . After 16 weeks of treatment , improvement in ABI , T ( C ) PO2 , and 6-min walk distance was significantly better in the PBMNC + PNS group . In addition , the combination of PBMNC transplantation and PNS administration yielded a greater reduction in ulcer area and severity of rest pain than did PBMNC transplantation alone . The proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event was similar between both treatment groups . Adverse events caused by PBMNC transplantation or PNS were generally mild and no serious adverse events occurred throughout the entire period of study . A combination of PNS and PBMNC transplantation appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with unreconstructable CLI . This combination may have great potential advantages in comparison with PBMNC transplantation alone and might constitute a novel therapeutic option for unreconstructable CLI .',\n",
       " ' Bone marrow ( BM ) dysfunction is common in severely injured trauma patients , resulting from elevated catecholamines and plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) as well as prolonged mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) . We have previously shown that propranolol ( - blocker [ BB ] ) reduces HPC mobilization in a rodent model of injury and hemorrhagic shock . We hypothesize that BB would prevent BM dysfunction in humans following severe injury . Forty-five severely injured trauma patients were studied in a prospective , randomized pilot trial . Twenty-five patients received BB , and 20 served as untreated controls . The dose of propranolol was adjusted to decrease the heart rate by 10 % to 20 % from baseline . Blood was analyzed for the presence of HPC ( blast-forming unit erythroid cells [ BFU-E ] and colony-forming unit erythroid cells ) and G-CSF . Demographic data , Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) , hemoglobin , reticulocyte number , and outcome data were obtained . The mean age of the study population was 33 years ; 87 % were male , with a mean ISS of 29 . There is a significant increase in BFU-E in peripheral blood immediately following traumatic injury , and this mobilization persists for 30 days . The use of BB significantly decreases BFU-E and colony-forming unit erythroid cells at all time points . G-CSF is significantly elevated in both groups on admission ; the use of BB decreases G-CSF levels by 51 % as compared with 37 % for controls . The average hemoglobin is nearly 1 g higher on the day of discharge with propranolol treatment ( BB , 9.9 0.4 g/dL vs. no BB , 9.1 0.6 g/dL ) . Following severe trauma , early treatment with propranolol following resuscitation is safe . The use of propranolol blunts early tachycardia , reduces HPC mobilization , and results in a faster return to baseline of the G-CSF peak seen after injury . There is also a trend toward faster recovery and resolution of anemia . Propranolol may be the first therapeutic agent to show improved BM function after severe injury .

In this 16-week ( 12-week treatment period , 4-week observation period ) , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase IIb study ( NCT00678210 ) , 197 patients were randomized to tofacitinib 2 , 5 or 15 mg BID , or placebo . Pruritus was patient assessed using the Itch Severity Score ( ISS ) , a 0-10 ( 10 = worst itching ) rating scale recorded daily from baseline to week 2 and at study visits . Mediation modeling was used to determine relationships between ISS ( average score weeks 2-12 ) , PGA ( average score weeks 2-12 ) and treatment groups . Mediation analysis showed that 70.2-80 .5 % ( p < 0.001 versus placebo ) of tofacitinib 's effect on pruritus was direct , and mostly independent of improvements in erythema , induration and scaling . ISS measurements had acceptable test-retest reliability . Correlation analyses with clinical outcomes supported the validity of the ISS as a pruritus measure . Tofacitinib has a direct , beneficial effect on patient-reported pruritus independent from improvements in clinician-reported psoriasis severity signs . The ISS demonstrated favorable psychometric characteristics , supporting its use as a pruritus assessment tool .\",\n",

The study included 90 patients with recent in-hospital violent behavior or highly regressed behavior . Hospitalization at the 500-bed state psychiatric hospital was two months or longer ( mean 5.4 years ) . Participants were randomly selected to receive ten weekly group therapy sessions of standardized equine-assisted psychotherapy ( EAP ) , canine-assisted psychotherapy ( CAP ) , enhanced social skills psychotherapy , or regular hospital care . Participants ' mean age was 44 , 37 % were female , 76 % had diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder , and 56 % had been committed involuntarily for civil or forensic reasons . Violence-related incident reports filed by staff in the three months after study intake were compared with reports two months preintake . Interventions were well tolerated . Analyses revealed an intervention group effect ( F = 3.00 , df = 3 and 86 , p = .035 ) ; post hoc tests showed specific benefits of EAP ( p < .05 ) . Similar AAT effects were found for the incidence of 1:1 clinical observation ( F = 2.70 , df = 3 and 86 , p = .051 ) ; post hoc tests suggested benefits of CAP ( p = .058 ) as well as EAP ( p = .082 ) . Covariance analyses indicated that staff can predict which patients are likely to benefit from EAP ( p = .01 ) .

       " ' There are currently no serum biomarkers capable of distinguishing elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) that portend serious liver injury potential from benign elevations such as those occurring during cholestyramine treatment . The aim of the research was to test the hypothesis that newly proposed biomarkers of hepatotoxicity would not significantly rise in serum during elevations in serum ALT associated with cholestyramine treatment , which has never been associated with clinically relevant liver injury . In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial , cholestyramine ( 8g ) was administered for 11 days to healthy adult volunteers . Serum from subjects with elevations in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) exceeding three-fold the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) were utilized for biomarker quantification . In 11 of 67 subjects , cholestyramine treatment resulted in ALT elevation by > 3x ULN ( mean 6.9 fold ; range 3-28 fold ) . In these 11 subjects , there was a 22.4-fold mean increase in serum levels of miR-122 relative to baseline , supporting a liver origin of the serum ALT . Significant elevations were noted in mean levels of necrosis biomarkers sorbitol dehydrogenase ( 8.1 fold ) , cytokeratin 18 ( 2.1 fold ) and HMGB1 ( 1.7 fold ) . Caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 , a biomarker of apoptosis was also significantly elevated ( 1.7 fold ) . A rise in glutamate dehydrogenase ( 7.3 fold ) may support mitochondrial dysfunction . All toxicity biomarkers measured in this study were elevated along with ALT , confirming the liver origin and reflecting both hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis . Since cholestyramine treatment has no clinical liver safety concerns , we conclude that interpretation of the biomarkers studied may not be straightforward in the context of assessing liver safety of new drugs .',\n",

       " ' We studied the unclear question whether blood pressure ( BP ) lowering reduces cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in elderly individuals with systolic BP < 160 mm Hg . We initiated a randomized placebo-controlled stratified 2 2 factorial clinical trial evaluating the effects of BP lowering in 11 000 elderly individuals with systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) between 130 and 159 mm Hg , for 5 years . Following 5-week active run-in , participants were randomized to aliskiren ( 300 mg ) or placebo , and to an additional antihypertensive [ hydrochlorothiazide ( 25 mg ) or amlodipine ( 5 mg ) ] , or their respective placeboes . Study was terminated by sponsor after 1759 subjects ( age 72.1 5.2 years , 88 % receiving at least one antihypertensive ) were randomized and followed for 0.6 year . Study drugs were well tolerated with few serious adverse events during run-in and after randomization , with no significant differences between treatment groups . By design , three levels of BP reductions were achieved , adjusted mean BP reductions of 3.5 / 1.7 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) by aliskiren , 6.8 / 3.3 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) by hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine , and 10.3 / 5.0 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) by double therapy compared with placebo . Twenty-five major CVD events occurred . Non-significant trends towards fewer CVD events with greater BP reductions are evident : hazard ratios ( HR ) 0.82 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.37-1 .81 ] for 3.5 mm Hg SBP reduction ; HR 0.45 ( 95 % CI : 0.19-1 .04 ) for 6.8 mm Hg ; and HR 0.25 ( 0.05-1 .18 ) for 10.3 mm Hg reduction for primary composite of CV death , MI , stroke , or significant heart failure . Sizeable reductions in BP , with potential for substantial CVD reduction , can be safely achieved using combinations of BP drugs in the elderly with normal high and Stage 1 hypertension .

       " ' As a result of research suggesting increased health risk with low serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol ( 25 ( OH ) D ) , health care providers are measuring it frequently . Providers and patients are faced with treatment choices when low status is identified . To compare the safety and efficacy of three vitamin D3 dietary supplements with different delivery matrices . A 12-week , parallel group , single-masked , clinical trial was conducted in Seattle , Washington and Kailua Kona , Hawaii . Sixty-six healthy adults with ( 25 ( OH ) D ) < 33 ng/mL were randomly assigned to take one of three D3 supplements , ie , a chewable tablet ( TAB ) , an oil-emulsified drop ( DROP ) , or an encapsulated powder ( CAP ) at a label-claimed dose of 10,000 IU/day . Actual D3 content was assessed by a third party and the results adjusted based on the actual D3 content administered . Mean change in 25 ( OH ) D/mcg D3 administered ; difference in the proportion of D3 insufficient participants ( ie , 25 ( OH ) D 30 ng/mL ) reaching sufficiency ( ie , 25 ( OH ) D 30 ng/mL ) ; and mean change in serum 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol were measured . In two of the three products tested , the measured vitamin D3 content varied considerably from the label-claimed dose . Differences in 25 ( OH ) D/mcg D3 administered were significantly different between groups ( P = .04 ; n = 55 ) . Pairwise comparisons demonstrated DROP resulted in a greater increase than TAB ( P < .05 ) but not than CAP . TAB was not different from CAP . The proportions reaching sufficiency were : 100 % ( TAB and CAP ) and 80 % ( DROP ) ( P = .03 between groups ; n = 55 ) . 1 , 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol did not change significantly in any group . Oil-emulsified vitamin D3 supplements resulted in a greater mean change in serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration , but fewer patients reaching vitamin D sufficiency , than chewable or encapsulated supplements .',\n",
       " ' In the REPAIR-AMI trial , intracoronary infusion of bone marrow-derived cells ( BMCs ) was associated with a significantly greater recovery of contractile function in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) at 4-month follow-up than placebo infusion . The current analysis investigates clinical outcome and predictors of event-free survival at 5 years . In the multicentre , placebo-controlled , double-blind REPAIR-AMI trial , 204 patients received intracoronary infusion of BMCs ( n = 101 ) or placebo ( n = 103 ) into the infarct vessel 3-7 days following successful percutaneous coronary intervention . Fifteen patients died in the placebo group compared with seven patients in the BMC group ( P = 0.08 ) . Nine placebo-treated patients and five BMC-treated patients required rehospitalization for chronic heart failure ( P = 0.23 ) . The combined endpoint cardiac/cardiovascular/unknown death or rehospitalisation for heart failure was more frequent in the placebo compared with the BMC group ( 18 vs. 10 events ; P = 0.10 ) . Univariate predictors of adverse outcomes were age , the CADILLAC risk score , aldosterone antagonist and diuretic treatment , changes in left ventricular ejection fraction , left ventricular end-systolic volume , and N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( all P < 0.01 ) at 4 months in the entire cohort and in the placebo group . In contrast , in the BMC group , only the basal ( P = 0.02 ) and the stromal cell-derived factor-1-induced ( P = 0.05 ) migratory capacity of the administered BMC were associated with improved clinical outcome . In patients of the REPAIR-AMI trial , established clinical parameters are associated with adverse outcome at 5 years exclusively in the placebo group , whereas the migratory capacity of the administered BMC determines event-free survival in the BMC-treated patients . These data disclose a potency-effect relationship between cell therapy and long-term outcome in patients with AMI .',\n",
       " \" Xpert MTB/RIF is approved for use in tuberculosis ( TB ) and rifampicin-resistance diagnosis . However , data are limited on the impact of Xpert under routine conditions in settings with high TB burden . A pragmatic prospective cluster-randomised trial of Xpert for all individuals with presumptive ( symptomatic ) TB compared to the routine diagnostic algorithm of sputum microscopy and limited use of culture was conducted in a large TB/HIV primary care clinic . The primary outcome was the proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases not initiating TB treatment by 3 mo after presentation . Secondary outcomes included time to TB treatment and mortality . Unblinded randomisation occurred on a weekly basis . Xpert and smear microscopy were performed on site . Analysis was both by intention to treat ( ITT ) and per protocol . Between 7 September 2010 and 28 October 2011 , 1,985 participants were assigned to the Xpert ( n = 982 ) and routine ( n = 1,003 ) diagnostic algorithms ( ITT analysis ) ; 882 received Xpert and 1,063 routine ( per protocol analysis ) . 13 % ( 32/257 ) of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB ( smear , culture , or Xpert ) did not initiate treatment by 3 mo after presentation in the Xpert arm , compared to 25 % ( 41/167 ) in the routine arm ( ITT analysis , risk ratio 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.33-0 .77 , p = 0.0052 ) . The yield of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases among patients with presumptive TB was 17 % ( 167/1 ,003 ) with routine diagnosis and 26 % ( 257/982 ) with Xpert diagnosis ( ITT analysis , risk ratio 1.57 , 95 % CI 1.32-1 .87 , p < 0.001 ) . This difference in diagnosis rates resulted in a higher rate of treatment initiation in the Xpert arm : 23 % ( 229/1 ,003 ) and 28 % ( 277/982 ) in the routine and Xpert arms , respectively ( ITT analysis , risk ratio 1.24 , 95 % CI 1.06-1 .44 , p = 0.013 ) . Time to treatment initiation was improved overall ( ITT analysis , hazard ratio 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.63-0 .92 , p = 0.005 ) and among HIV-infected participants ( ITT analysis , hazard ratio 0.67 , 95 % CI 0.53-0 .85 , p = 0.001 ) . There was no difference in 6-mo mortality with Xpert versus routine diagnosis . Study limitations included incorrect intervention allocation for a high proportion of participants and that the study was conducted in a single clinic . These data suggest that in this routine primary care setting , use of Xpert to diagnose TB increased the number of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB who were treated by 3 mo and reduced time to treatment initiation , particularly among HIV-infected participants .

       " ' Circumsporozoite protein ( CS ) is the antigenic target for RTS , S , the most advanced malaria vaccine to date . Heterologous prime-boost with the viral vectors simian adenovirus 63 ( ChAd63 ) - modified vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) is the most potent inducer of T-cells in humans , demonstrating significant efficacy when expressing the preerythrocytic antigen insert multiple epitope-thrombospondin-related adhesion protein ( ME-TRAP ) . We hypothesized that ChAd63-MVA containing CS may result in a significant clinical protective efficacy . We conducted an open-label , 2-site , partially randomized Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite controlled human malaria infection ( CHMI ) study to compare the clinical efficacy of ChAd63-MVA CS with ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP . One of 15 vaccinees ( 7 % ) receiving ChAd63-MVA CS and 2 of 15 ( 13 % ) receiving ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP achieved sterile protection after CHMI . Three of 15 vaccinees ( 20 % ) receiving ChAd63-MVA CS and 5 of 15 ( 33 % ) receiving ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP demonstrated a delay in time to treatment , compared with unvaccinated controls . In quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses , ChAd63-MVA CS was estimated to reduce the liver parasite burden by 69 % -79 % , compared with 79 % -84 % for ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP . ChAd63-MVA CS does reduce the liver parasite burden , but ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP remains the most promising antigenic insert for a vectored liver-stage vaccine . Detailed analyses of parasite kinetics may allow detection of smaller but biologically important differences in vaccine efficacy that can influence future vaccine development . NCT01623557 .',\n",
       " ' The purpose of the study was to compare behavioral outcomes ( physical activity , sedentary behavior , smoking cessation , diet ) between the intervention and usual care conditions from the TEAMcare trial . TEAMcare was a randomized trial among 214 adults with depression and poorly controlled diabetes and/or coronary heart disease that promoted health behavior change and pharmacotherapy to improve health . Behavioral outcomes were measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( physical activity , sitting time ) and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure ( smoking , diet , exercise ) . Poisson regression models among completers ( N = 185 ) were conducted adjusting for age , education , smoking status and depression . Intervention participants had more days/week following a healthy eating plan [ relative rate = 1.2 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.1-1 .4 ] and more days of participation in 30 min of physical activity ( relative rate = 1.2 , 95 % CI = 1.1-2 .0 ) compared to usual care . Intervention participants were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines ( 7.5 % increase ) compared to usual care ( 12 % decrease ; P = .053 ) . Diet and activity generally improved for those receiving the intervention , while there were no differences in some aspects of diet ( fruit and vegetable and high-fat food intake ) , smoking status and sitting time between conditions in the TEAMcare trial .',\n",
       " ' The 2010 American Heart Association guidelines suggested an increase in cardiopulmonary resuscitation compression depth with a target > 50 mm and no upper limit . This target is based on limited evidence , and we sought to determine the optimal compression depth range . We studied emergency medical services-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed Analysis clinical trial and the Epistry-Cardiac Arrest database . We calculated adjusted odds ratios for survival to hospital discharge , 1-day survival , and any return of circulation . We included 9136 adult patients from 9 US and Canadian cities with a mean age of 67.5 years , mean compression depth of 41.9 mm , and a return of circulation of 31.3 % , 1-day survival of 22.8 % , and survival to hospital discharge of 7.3 % . For survival to discharge , the adjusted odds ratios were 1.04 ( 95 % CI , 1.00-1 .08 ) for each 5-mm increment in compression depth , 1.45 ( 95 % CI , 1.20-1 .76 ) for cases within 2005 depth range ( > 38 mm ) , and 1.05 ( 95 % CI , 1.03-1 .08 ) for percentage of minutes in depth range ( 10 % change ) . Covariate-adjusted spline curves revealed that the maximum survival is at a depth of 45.6 mm ( 15-mm interval with highest survival between 40.3 and 55.3 mm ) with no differences between men and women . This large study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients demonstrated that increased cardiopulmonary resuscitation compression depth is strongly associated with better survival . Our adjusted analyses , however , found that maximum survival was in the depth interval of 40.3 to 55.3 mm ( peak , 45.6 mm ) , suggesting that the 2010 American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitation guideline target may be too high . http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

       " ' Former sleep studies among non-treatment seeking chronic cocaine users had captured polysomnographic changes for as long as three weeks of abstinence . 20 cocaine dependent participants , randomized to placebo in an ongoing clinical trial , received 12 days of inpatient substance abuse treatment followed by 6 weeks of outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy . Polysomnographic recording was performed on consecutive nights during the 1st and 2nd inpatient and 3rd and 6th outpatient weeks . Number of days abstinent was determined from thrice weekly urine toxicology and self-report . Polysomnographic sleep was compared between study week 1 and 2 , using paired t-tests . Trajectory of total sleep time ( TST ) was modeled both as a linear and a quadratic function of days abstinent . Despite reporting an improvement in overall sleep quality , polysomnographic sleep worsened from week 1 to 2 . Among all participants , TST and stage 2 sleep time decreased , while REM sleep latency increased . Among participants who began the study with a positive urine test , there was also a decrease in REM and a trend for decreased slow wave sleep . TST compared to number of days abstinent ( up to 54 days ) was best fit with a quadratic model ( p = 0.002 ) , suggesting the possibility of an improvement in total sleep time with extended abstinence . This is the first polysomnographic characterization of sleep in a large sample of cocaine users in treatment . Present findings confirm earlier results of poor and deteriorating sleep early in abstinence , and raise the possibility of improvement after an extended abstinence .',\n",

The long-term soft tissue problems were similar in the two groups , thus favoring the linear incision , which is less invasive .\",\n",
       " ' The combined IVGTT-hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp ( Botnia clamp ) allows the assessment of insulin secretion and sensitivity in one experiment . It remains unclear whether this clamp yields results comparable with those of the standard hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp ( SHEC ) in diabetes patients . We hypothesised that the IVGTT induces responses affecting insulin sensitivity assessment . Of 22 randomised diet - or metformin-treated patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes , 19 randomly underwent a Botnia clamp and an SHEC , spaced by 2 weeks , in one clinical research centre in a crossover study . The main outcomes were whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity as measured by the clamp and [ 6,6 - ( 2 ) H2 ] glucose . Substrate utilisation was assessed from indirect calorimetry and beta cell function from insulin dynamics during IVGTT . The values of whole-body insulin sensitivity obtained from Botnia clamp and SHEC were correlated ( r = 0.87 , p < 0.001 ) , but also revealed intra-individual variations . Hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between experiments during the clamp , but differed after IVGTT . The contribution of glucose oxidation to glucose disposal increased by 2.2 0.3 and 1.2 0.4 mg kg fat-free mass ( FFM ) ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ( Botnia and SHEC , p < 0.05 ) , whereas lipid oxidation decreased by 0.8 0.1 and 0.4 0.1 mg kg FFM ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ( p < 0.05 ) from baseline . Differences in NEFA ( r = -0.60 , p < 0.01 ) , but not C-peptide ( r = -0.16 , p = 0.52 ) or hepatic insulin sensitivity between IVGTT and placebo before the clamps correlated with individual variations of insulin sensitivity . The Botnia clamp provides similar estimates of insulin sensitivity as SHEC in patients with type 2 diabetes , but changes in NEFA during IVGTT may affect insulin sensitivity and thereby the discrimination between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals .

They were randomly divided into the intervention group , to receive 250 mg of vitamin C , three times per week , for 8 weeks , and control groups 1 and 2 , to receive placebo injection ( saline ) and no intervention , respectively . Serum levels of uric acid and creatinine were measured at the start of the study and also after 8 weeks . The mean of serum levels of uric acid was 6.02 1.08 mg/dL ( reference range , 2.6 mg/dL to 6 mg/dL ) . Nearly , half of the patients ( 46.7 % ) had a serum level of uric acid greater than 6 mg/dL . The median baseline serum levels of uric acid were 6.2 mg/dL , 5.9 mg/dL , and 6 mg/dL in the intervention , control 1 , and control 2 groups , respectively ( P = .19 ) .

       " \" Acute appendicitis is the most common reason for abdominal surgery in young adults and children . Open appendectomy is still the treatment often chosen because it is simple , safe , and effective . Our aim was to study whether cosmetic results of appendectomy wounds are better after using continuous absorbable intradermal ( A ) sutures compared with wound closure with interrupted nonabsorbable ( NA ) sutures . A total of 206 adult patients with clinically suspected appendicitis were allocated to the study and prospectively randomized into two wound-closure groups : the interrupted NA suture group and the A suture group . Of these , 193 patients with sufficient data were invited to the outpatient clinic for cosmetic analysis . Cosmetic results were evaluated after a median of 14 months . For subjective scar assessment , the Vancouver scar scale , the patient and observer scar assessment scale ( POSAS ) , and a visual analog scale ( VAS ) were used . Objective evaluation was carried out by measuring surface area , average width , and estimated concentration change ( ECC ) of hemoglobin and melanin in the scar using spectrocutometry . For statistical analyses we used the Mann-Whitney test and Student 's t test . Both objective and subjective analyses showed better cosmetic results for absorbable intradermal suturing . The difference between the two groups was statistically significant as regards POSAS in both patient ( p = 0.032 ) and observer scales ( p = 0.001 ) , and VAS ( p = 0.002 ) . Scar surface area was significantly smaller in group A than in group NA ( p = 0.002 ) . ECC measurements showed higher values for melanin in group NA than in group A ( p = 0.034 ) . Continuous intradermal absorbable suturing yields a better cosmetic result than interrupted nonabsorbable suturing in lower abdominal transverse appendectomy .\",\n",
       " ' We investigated 3 approaches for implementing the Chronic Care Model to improve diabetes care : ( 1 ) practice facilitation over 6 months using a reflective adaptive process ( RAP ) approach ; ( 2 ) practice facilitation for up to 18 months using a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) approach ; and ( 3 ) providing self-directed ( SD ) practices with model information and resources , without facilitation . We conducted a cluster-randomized trial , called Enhancing Practice , Improving Care ( EPIC ) , that compared these approaches among 40 small to midsized primary care practices . At baseline and 9 months and 18 months after enrollment , we assessed practice diabetes quality measures from chart audits and Practice Culture Assessment scores from clinician and staff surveys . Although measures of the quality of diabetes care improved in all 3 groups ( all P < .05 ) , improvement was greater in CQI practices compared with both SD practices ( P < .0001 ) and RAP practices ( P < .0001 ) ; additionally , improvement was greater in SD practices compared with RAP practices ( P < .05 ) . In RAP practices , Change Culture scores showed a trend toward improvement at 9 months ( P = .07 ) but decreased below baseline at 18 months ( P < .05 ) , while Work Culture scores decreased from 9 to 18 months ( P < .05 ) . Both scores were stable over time in SD and CQI practices . Traditional CQI interventions are effective at improving measures of the quality of diabetes care , but may not improve practice change and work culture . Short-term practice facilitation based on RAP principles produced less improvement in quality measures than CQI or SD interventions and also did not produce sustained improvements in practice culture .',\n",

This study aims at investigating the feasibility and repeatability of thrombus quantification prior to stent implantation using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patients . Patients were enrolled in an OCT substudy of the TOTAL trial ( a randomized trial of routine aspiration ThrOmbecTomy with PCI vs. PCI ALone in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI ) of aspiration thrombectomy or percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) alone in primary PCI ( PPCI ) of STEMI . Using OCT , thrombus burden ( TB ) and other measures of pre - and post-stent atherothrombus were analysed over the arterial segment defined by the final stent length . Feasibility was 86.2 % ( 25/29 patients ) for both pre - and post-stent OCT imaging . Altogether , 8111 OCT cross-sections were analysed . In Bland-Altman analyses of inter-observer variation ( n = 25 ) , the mean pre-stent TB was 8.76 % for Observer 1 and 8.97 % for Observer 2 ( limits of agreement -2.6 to 2.2 % ) . In Bland-Altman analyses of intra-observer variation ( n = 15 ) , the mean pre-stent TB was 8.06 % for the first and 7.35 % for the second round of analysis by Observer 1 ( limits of agreement -1.72 to 3.15 % ) . There was a good correlation between pre-stent TB and pre-stent quadrants with thrombus/mm ( r = 0.97 ) , but only modest correlation between pre-stent TB and post-stent atherothrombotic burden ( ATB ; r = 0.54 ) . Measurement of pre-stent TB by OCT during the PPCI of STEMI is feasible and highly repeatable . Pre-stent TB is only modestly correlated with post-stent ATB , which indicates that pre-stent measurements might be of additional value when assessing the TB in STEMI .',\n",

Statistical analyses used McNemar 's and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests , Spearman 's rank-order correlation , and multiple linear regression . Surgery significantly improved POP-Q , PFIQ-7 , and PFDI-20 scores , including subscales . We observed weak correlations between POP-Q and PFIQ-7 , including subscales ( r 0.173-0 .324 , p < 0.05 ) , and PFDI-20 , including the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory ( POPDI ) subscale ( r 0.180-0 .211 , p < 0.05 ) . Regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between point Ba and PFIQ-7 ( p = 0.001 ) and PFDI-20 ( p = 0.04 ) , respectively . Furthermore , we observed a significant relationship between the change in point Ba ( following surgery ) and change in scores ; point Ba following surgery was significantly correlated with symptoms of bulging ( r = 0.303 , p < 0.01 ) and bladder-emptying problems ( r = 0.213 , p < 0.01 ) . The weak correlation between POP-Q and urogenital symptoms based on questionnaire scores suggests that neither scoring system is optimal .\",\n",
       " \" Pressure ulcers are one of the most common health complaints , which often take months or years to heal , and affect patients ' morbidity and quality of life . Medical options for pressure ulcers are limited . Electroacupuncture ( EA ) has been employed to relieve the symptoms for patients with pressure ulcers , but there is limited clinical evidence for its effectiveness . This study consists of a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with two parallel arms : a control group and an EA group .

In addition , the EA group will receive the EA intervention . The following outcome measurements will be used in examination of participants : wound surface area ( WSA ) , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , and the proportion of ulcers healed within trial period ( PUHTP ) . All the outcomes will be evaluated at the start of the study , at the end of the fourth week , at 8 weeks after randomization , and 1 month after treatment cessation . The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of EA for the treatment of patients with pressure ulcers . Chinese Clinical Trial Register : ChiCTR-TRC-11001693 .\",\n",
       " ' Although statins can induce coronary atheroma regression , this benefit has yet to be demonstrated in diabetic individuals . We tested the hypothesis that high-intensity statin therapy may promote coronary atheroma regression in patients with diabetes . The Study of Coronary Atheroma by Intravascular Ultrasound : Effect of Rosuvastatin Versus Atorvastatin ( SATURN ) used serial intravascular ultrasound measures of coronary atheroma volume in patients treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg for 24 months . This analysis compared changes in biochemistry and coronary percent atheroma volume ( PAV ) in patients with ( n = 159 ) and without ( n = 880 ) diabetes . At baseline , patients with diabetes had lower LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels but higher triglyceride and CRP levels compared with patients without diabetes . At follow-up , diabetic patients had lower levels of LDL-C ( 61.0 20.5 vs. 66.4 22.9 mg/dL , P = 0.01 ) and HDL-C ( 46.3 10.6 vs. 49.9 12.0 mg/dL , P < 0.001 ) but higher levels of triglycerides ( 127.6 [ 98.8 , 163.0 ] vs. 113.0 mg/dL [ 87.6 , 151.9 ] , P = 0.001 ) and CRP ( 1.4 [ 0.7 , 3.3 ] vs. 1.0 [ 0.5 , 2.1 ] mg/L , P = 0.001 ) . Both patients with and without diabetes demonstrated regression of coronary atheroma as measured by change in PAV ( -0.83 0.13 vs. -1.15 0.13 % , P = 0.08 ) . PAV regression was less in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients when on-treatment LDL-C levels were > 70 mg/dL ( -0.31 0.23 vs. -1.01 0.21 % , P = 0.03 ) but similar when LDL-C levels were 70 mg/dL ( -1.09 0.16 vs. -1.24 0.16 % , P = 0.50 ) . High-intensity statin therapy alters the progressive nature of diabetic coronary atherosclerosis , yielding regression of disease in diabetic and nondiabetic patients .',\n",
       " ' To evaluate the effects of different intracorporeal ligation techniques with titanium clips , Plasma Trisector ( Gyrus , USA ) ( PTG ) , and surgical silk on bilateral laparoscopic varicocelectomy ( LPVx ) . Between May 2009 and August 2012 , 100 patients who underwent bilateral LPVx were evaluated . The demographic parameters of patients , preoperative radiological findings , semen analysis , operative data , and follow-up were recorded . All of the patients were divided into 3 groups , randomized prospectively . The patients whose veins were ligated by 5-mm titanium clips were included in group I , those whose veins were ligated by PTG were included in group II , and those whose veins were ligated by surgical silk were included in group III . The recorded data of the groups were analyzed . Mean follow-up time was 18.8 + 1.1 months . According to the demographics of age , body mass index , spermiogram , and diameter of veins before surgery , there were no statistical differences between any of the groups ( P > 0.05 ) . However , operation time was longer in group III ( P < 0.0001 ) , while total numbers ofligated veins did not differ among the groups ( P > 0.05 ) . Additionally , hospital stay , oral intake , and complications were not different among the groups ( P > 0.05 ) . In follow-up the sperm count analysis was higher than the preoperative count analysis for all of the groups ( P < 0.05 ) . PTG may provide a shorter operation time than using titanium clips and/or surgical silk in LPVx . Additionally , PTG may increase sperm count with fewer complications than the other ligation techniques in LPVx . Therefore , PTG may be the new candidate electrosurgical standard device for LPVx in the nearby future .',\n",
       " ' To compare the level of anxiety and performance of nursing students when performing a clinical simulation through the traditional method of assessment with the presence of an evaluator and through a filmed assessment without the presence of an evaluator . Controlled trial with the participation of Brazilian public university 20 students who were randomly assigned to one of two groups : a ) assessment through the traditional method with the presence of an evaluator ; or b ) filmed assessment . The level of anxiety was assessed using the Zung test and performance was measured based on the number of correct answers . Averages of 32 and 27 were obtained on the anxiety scale by the group assessed through the traditional method before and after the simulation , respectively , while the filmed group obtained averages of 33 and 26 ; the final scores correspond to mild anxiety . Even though there was a statistically significant reduction in the intra-groups scores before and after the simulation , there was no difference between the groups . As for the performance assessments in the clinical simulation , the groups obtained similar percentages of correct answers ( 83 % in the traditional assessment and 84 % in the filmed assessment ) without statistically significant differences . Filming can be used and encouraged as a strategy to assess nursing undergraduate students .',\n",

Individuals aged 50-69 years were invited to receive one FIT sample ( cutoff 75 ng ml ( -1 ) ) between November 2008 and June 2011 . Faecal immunochemical test was positive in 9.3 % ( 21 out of 224 ) of users of OAC and 6.2 % ( 365 out of 5821 ) of non-users ( P-trend = 0.07 ) . The positive predictive value ( PPV ) for advanced neoplasia ( AN ) in non-users was 50.4 % vs 47.6 % in users ( odds ratio , 0.70 ; 95 % CI , 0.3-1 .8 ; P = 0.5 ) . The PPV for AN in OAC more antiplatelets ( aspirin or clopidogrel ) was 75 % ( odds ratio , 2 ; 95 % CI , 0.4-10 .8 ; P = 0.4 ) . Oral anticoagulant did not significantly modify the PPV for AN in this population-based colorectal screening program .

       " ' Virtual patients ( VPs ) offer valuable alternative encounters when live patients with rare conditions , such as cranial nerve ( CN ) palsies , are unavailable ; however , little is known regarding simulation and optimal social learning context . Compare learning outcomes and perspectives between students interacting with VPs in individual and team contexts . Seventy-eight medical students were randomly assigned to interview and examine four VPs with possible CN damage either as individuals or in three-person teams , using Neurological Examination Rehearsal Virtual Environment ( NERVE ) . Learning was measured through diagnosis accuracy and pre - / post-simulation knowledge scores . Perspectives of learning context were collected post-simulation . Students in teams submitted correct diagnoses significantly more often than students as individuals for CN-IV ( p = 0.04 ; team = 86.1 % ; individual = 65.9 % ) and CN-VI ( p = 0.03 ; team = 97.2 % ; individual = 80.5 % ) . Knowledge scores increased significantly in both contexts ( p < 0.001 ) ; however , a significant aptitude-treatment interaction effect was observed ( p = 0.04 ) . At pre-test scores 25.8 % , students in teams scored significantly higher ( 66.7 % ) than students as individuals ( 43.1 % ) at post-test ( p = 0.03 ) . Students recommended implementing future NERVE exercises in teams over five other modality-timing combinations . Results allow us to define best practices for integrating VP simulators into medical education . Implementing NERVE experiences in team environments with medical students in the future may be preferable .',\n",
       " ' Exercise-induced cough ( EIC ) is frequently reported by winter athletes , but this symptom is not always associated with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) . The aims of this study were to determine if EIC can be inhibited or reduced with the inhalation of ipratropium , and if EIC in winter athletes is associated with EIB . On 2 visits , 24 cross-country skiers ( 10 males and 12 females , mean age 17 3 years ) performed an outdoor exercise in the winter ( 30-minute warm-up , followed by a 3-minute sprint ) , randomly preceded by the inhalation of ipratropium or a placebo . A spirometry was done at baseline and 20 minutes after inhalation of ipratropium or placebo . Exercise was then performed , followed by the measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and the recording of the number of coughs until 60 minutes after exercise . Before and after exercise , the perception of cough intensity was evaluated using a modified Borg scale . Twelve of 16 athletes who completed the study ( 75 % ) were symptomatic following exercise with placebo ( number of coughs 5 ) , but none developed EIB . For these athletes , the number of coughs after exercise ( mean number of coughs standard deviation : placebo , 26 14 ; ipratropium , 25 23 ; P value , nonsignificant ) and the maximal perception score for cough intensity ( mean Borg score standard deviation : placebo , 1.9 1.2 ; ipratropium , 2.0 1.1 ; P value , nonsignificant ) were not significantly different between ipratropium and placebo . A decrease in the number of coughs was observed in 6 of the symptomatic athletes and an increase was observed in the other 6 , resulting in a nonsignificant mean effect . Ipratropium does not appear to significantly influence the number and the perception of cough following exercise . Moreover , these results suggest that EIC is not mainly associated with EIB . However , a subgroup of athletes seems to show a beneficial response to ipratropium , suggesting different cough responses in this population .',\n",
       " ' The Avosentan on Time to Doubling of Serum Creatinine , End Stage Renal Disease or Death ( ASCEND ) trial tested the renoprotective effect of the endothelin receptor antagonist avosentan in patients with diabetes and nephropathy , but the study was terminated due to an excess of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) events in the avosentan arms , likely due to fluid retention . The aim of this study was to identify risk markers of CHF after treatment with avosentan . In a post hoc analysis of the ASCEND trial ( N = 1392 participants ) , we assessed which baseline characteristics predicted CHF risk during avosentan treatment . Furthermore , postrandomization changes between baseline and the first available measurement of body weight and hemoglobin were examined as potential clinical indicators of fluid retention for their relationship with CHF development . Relative to placebo , avosentan increased CHF risk ( hazard ratio , 2.76 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.68 to 4.54 ) . The avosentan-related CHF risk was higher with lower baseline cholesterol levels ( P interaction = 0.003 ) and concomitant statin use ( P interaction = 0.06 ) , whereas it was lower with a lower estimated GFR ( P interaction = 0.04 ) . Patients allocated to avosentan had a median body weight increase of 0.6 kg ( interquartile range , 0.0 to 2.0 kg ) and a median hemoglobin decrease of 1.4 g/dl ( interquartile range , -2.1 to -0.7 g/dl ) at the first postrandomization measurement . The body weight increase induced by avosentan was associated with CHF development ( P interaction = 0.04 ) , whereas hemoglobin decrease was not ( P interaction = 0.64 ) . The increase in body weight was particularly pronounced in patients with a cardiovascular disease history and in patients using statins . In avosentan-treated patients , body weight increase , but not hemoglobin decrease , was associated with CHF development , indicating that close body weight monitoring could provide an early signal of CHF development in future trials with endothelin receptor antagonists .',\n",
       " ' The aim of this study was to measure round window ( RW ) diameters in patients with congenital aural atresia ( CAA ) or sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL ) and a normal control group and to analyze whether differences exist between these groups . Temporal bone computed tomographic scans of 12 patients with CAA ( 5 males , 7 females ) aged 1 to 50 years ( median age , 6 years ) , 12 patients with SNHL ( 8 males , 4 females ) aged 2 to 32 years ( median age , 5 years ) , and 11 patients ( 3 males , 7 females ) aged 2 months to 53 years ( median age , 8 years ) randomly selected from a pool of patients with unilateral chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma were reviewed . We measured RW diameter on oblique reconstruction planes . To prevent possible individual differences , skull width was measured . There were no statistically significant differences between all groups for skull width . Both RW diameter and RW membrane width were found smaller in the CAA group than both SNHL group and control group with statistical significance , whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the SNHL group and the control group . We found that both the RW diameter and RW membrane width in CAA were smaller than those in the control group . If this finding is supported in future studies , the production of floating mass transducer with different sizes may be useful . We suggest that RW diameter should be measured in each patient before operation and thus a floating mass transducer with the appropriate caliber should be chosen .',\n",

Thirty-nine pediatric patients who had median sternotomy were recruited in this prospective randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled split-scar experimental study . The wound in each patient was divided into upper and lower parts , and the treatment with , either onion extract gel or placebo was randomly applied by block randomization onto each part of the wound twice daily after the seventh day postoperatively for six months . The incidence of scars , serial photographs of the wound , Vancouver Scar Scale ( VSS ) , and adverse effect were assessed at each visit . Thirty patients with the mean age of 4.3 years completed the 6-month study period . Six patients ( 20 % ) in onion extract gel group had no scar compared to one patient ( 3.3 % ) in placebo group ( p = 0.04 ) . Of the 27 patients with hypertrophic scar nine were from onion extract gel group and 18 from the placebo group ( p = 0.02 ) . Keloid was not statistically significant diferent in both groups ( p = 0.29 ) . VSS was not statistically significant different in all visits . One case had a pustule on the part of the onion extract in silicone derivative application at the sixth month . Onion extract in silicone derivative gel can significantly decreased the incidence of hypertrophic scar from median sternotomy wound in pediatric patients .

       " ' To investigate the characteristics of residual symptoms and to evaluate the effects of adjuvant vestibular suppressants on residual symptoms after successful canalith repositioning procedures ( CRPs ) . Individual randomized controlled trial . One hundred fifty patients with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who achieved successful CRPs on initial visit participated in this study . Dizziness Handicap Inventory ( DHI ) questionnaires were completed before CRPs . All study populations were divided into three groups after successful CRPs on the initial visit day : the medication ( V ) group ( treated with a vestibular suppressant [ dimenhydrinate 50 mg per day ] ) , the placebo ( P ) group , and the no medication ( N ) group . One week after successful CRPs , residual symptoms were checked and repeated DHI questionnaires were completed to compare residual symptoms . Among the 138 patients who did not show positional nystagmus at follow-up , 67 ( 48.5 % ) complained of residual symptoms . The presence of residual symptoms was more prevalent in the P and N group compared with the V group ( P = .035 , P = .017 , respectively ) . The most frequent residual symptom was lightheadedness ( n = 42 ) . Moreover , in the V group , lightheadedness was significantly reduced compared with the P group ( P = .029 ) . However , in the analysis of DHI , total and subscale scores did not differ across the three groups before or after successful CRP . Vestibular suppressants significantly reduced residual symptoms compared to both placebo and no medication after CRP . However , there was no significant reduction in DHI score compared with the control group , suggesting that the residual symptoms could not be evaluated by DHI score alone .',\n",

This prospective study was conducted among 238 rectal/anal cancer patients undergoing intersphincteric resection at our center between January , 2010 and January , 2011 , among whom 150 were eligible to be included and completed the study . The 150 patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion into 3 equal groups to receive immunomodulatory therapy with 8 mg/kg celecoxib ( group A ) , 0.4 mg/kg Sou-Medrol ( group B ) , or placebo ( group C ) , given daily from 5 days before surgery to 5 days after surgery , and the postoperative cancer recurrence were compared . At 3 days after the operation , the 3 groups showed significantly different C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels , which decreased obviously in all the 3 groups compared with those at 1 day following the operation ( P = 0.022 ) , especially in group B. The levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) at 3 days after the operation also differed significantly between the 3 groups but were lower in all the 3 groups than those at 1 day after the operation ( P = 0.046 ) , and this reduction was the most obvious in group A. COX-2 expression differed significantly between the 3 groups ( P = 0.017 ) , among which group A showed the most obvious suppression of COX-2 expression . During the follow-up for a mean of 45 months , no significant difference in the recurrence rate was found between the 3 groups ( P = 0.549 ) . With a lower efficacy than Sou-Medrol in decreasing postoperative inflammation , celecoxib produces a better effect in inhibiting COX-2 expression , but it does not lower postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer .',\n",
       " \" In trials of behavioural interventions , the individuals who deliver the intervention are in a position of key influence on the success of the trial . Their fidelity to the intervention is crucial . Yet little is understood about the experiences of this group of trial personnel . This study aimed to investigate the views and experiences of educators who delivered a structured education intervention to people with type 2 diabetes , which incorporated training in self-monitoring of either blood glucose ( SMBG ) or urine glucose ( SMUG ) as part of a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) . Educators ' views were explored through focus groups before and after training ( N = 18 ) and approximately 1 year into the trial ( N = 14 ) , and semi-structured telephone interviews at approximately 2 years ( N = 7 ) . Analysis was based on the constant comparative method . Educators held preferences regarding the intervention variants ; thus , they were not in individual equipoise . Training raised awareness of preferences and their potential to impact on delivery . Educators were confident in their unbiased delivery , but acknowledged the challenges involved . Concealing their preferences was helped by a sense of professionalism , the patient-centred nature of the intervention , and concessions in the trial protocol ( enabling participants to swap monitoring methods if needed ) . Commitment to unbiased delivery was explained through a desire for evidence-based knowledge in the contentious area of SMBG . The findings provide insight into a previously unexplored group of trial personnel -- intervention deliverers in trials of behavioural interventions -- which will be useful to those designing and running similar trials . Rather than individual equipoise , it is intervention deliverers ' awareness of personal preferences and their potential impact on the trial outcome that facilitates unbiased delivery . Further , awareness of community equipoise , the need for evidence , and relevance to the individual enhance commitment to the RCT . ISRCTN95696668 .\",\n",
       " \" The purpose of this study is to determine whether varying the format used to present prognostic data alters the perception of risk among surrogate decision makers in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . This was a prospective randomized comparative trial conducted in a 23-bed adult tertiary ICU . Enrolled surrogate decision makers were randomized to 1 of 2 questionnaires , which presented hypothetical ICU scenarios , identical other than the format in which prognostic data were presented ( eg , frequencies vs percentages ) . Participants were asked to rate the risk associated with each prognostic statement . We enrolled 141 surrogate decision makers . The perception of risk varied significantly dependent on the presentation format . For `` quantitative data , '' risks were consistently perceived as higher , when presented as frequencies ( eg , 1 in 50 ) compared with equivalent percentages ( eg , 2 % ) . Framing `` qualitative data '' in terms of chance of `` death '' rather than `` survival '' led to a statistically significant increase in perceived risks . Framing `` quantitative '' data in this way did not significantly affect risk perception . Data format had a significant effect on how surrogate decision makers interpreted risk . Qualitative statements are interpreted widely and affected by framing . Where possible , multiple quantitative formats should be used for presenting prognostic information .\",\n",

In both groups , maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) was evaluated before training , at the 9 ( th ) and 17 ( th ) session and four days after the final 24 ( th ) training session . In the detraining phase VO2max was evaluated after 12 days and thereafter every second week for eight weeks . Left ventricular echocardiography , carbon monoxide lung diffusion transfer factor , brachial artery flow mediated dilatation and vastus lateralis citrate maximal synthase activity was tested before and after training . The cardiovascular adaptation after HF training was delayed compared to training with MF . Four days after ending training the HF group showed no improvement ( +3.0 % , p = 0.126 ) , whereas the MF group reached their highest VO2max with a 10.7 % improvement ( p < 0.001 : group difference p = 0.035 ) .

Older adults identified as having difficulty managing their medications at discharge from Medicare Home Health Care ( N = 414 ) . A team consisting of advanced practice nurses ( APNs ) and registered nurses ( RNs ) coordinated care for two groups : home-based nurse care coordination ( NCC ) plus a pill organizer group and NCC plus a medication-dispensing machine group . To measure cost , participant claims data from 2005 to 2011 were retrieved from Medicare Part A and B Standard Analytical Files . Ordinary least squares regression with covariate adjustment was used to estimate monthly dollar savings . Total Medicare costs were $ 447 per month lower in the NCC plus pill organizer group ( P = .11 ) than in a control group that received usual care . For participants in the study at least 3 months , total Medicare costs were $ 491 lower per month in the NCC plus pill organizer group ( P = .06 ) than in the control group . The cost of the NCC plus pill organizer intervention was $ 151 per month , yielding a net savings of $ 296 per month or $ 3,552 per year . The cost of the NCC plus medication-dispensing machine intervention was $ 251 per month , and total Medicare costs were $ 409 higher per month than in the NCC plus pill organizer group . Nurse care coordination plus a pill organizer is a cost-effective intervention for frail elderly Medicare beneficiaries .

       " \" Numerous animal studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that erythropoietin ( EPO ) has therapeutic effects in ischemic and degenerative diseases . However , few clinical trials have investigated the effect of EPO in Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients . This study was an exploratory pilot study to investigate the effects of recombinant human EPO ( rhEPO ) on motor and non-motor symptoms ( NMS ) in PD patients . A total of 26 PD patients at the Hanyang University Hospital were enrolled in the study . The participants were randomly assigned to rhEPO and placebo groups . The rhEPO group was infused intravenously ( 40,000 IU each ) twice a week for 5 weeks . Clinical improvement was estimated using the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale-III ( UPDRS-III ) , the NMS Scale ( NMSS ) and the 39-Item Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire ( PDQ-39 ) . [ ( 18 ) F ] N - ( 3-fluoropropyl ) -2 - carbon ethoxy-3 - ( 4-iodophenyl ) nortropane ( FP-CIT ) photon emission tomography ( PET ) scanning was performed on each participant at baseline and again after 12 months . The rhEPO administration significantly improved the NMSS and PDQ-39 scores at 12 months . The UPDRS-III , which reflects motor function , did not change significantly after the rhEPO treatment . With the NMSS , the domains of cardiovascular autonomic function , sleep/fatigue , mood/cognition and attention/memory showed significant changes . None of the participants experienced any serious adverse effects . We found that rhEPO had beneficial effects on NMS but not on motor function . Dopaminergic refractory NMS , such as cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cognition , showed improvement after the administration of rhEPO . Our results suggest that rhEPO might be a good candidate for the treatment of NMS in PD patients .\",\n",

Pulmonary function was evaluated with ; forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume during one second ( FEV1 ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , and cough PEF . Pain was recorded using a visual analog scale ( VAS ) . All patients completed the ventral hernia pain questionnaire ( VHPQ ) before surgery and at the end of the study . Intra-abdominal pressure was measured via an indwelling urinary catheter . Wound healing was assessed from photographs . FVC , FEV1 , PEF , and cough PEF were reduced by about 30 % after surgery , but there were no differences between patients with or without a girdle ( ANOVA ) . Intra-abdominal pressure and wound healing were the same in both groups . Pain was significantly lower on day 5 in the girdle group ( p = 0.004 ) . An individually fitted elastic girdle used after midline laparotomy was found to be safe , as this did not affect lung function , coughing , intra-abdominal pressure , or wound healing . The immediate decline in lung function after surgery is restrictive and due to anesthesia and the surgical procedure . Pain was significantly decreased in the girdle group .

       " ' Sexual dimorphism in plasma triglyceride ( TG ) metabolism is well established but it is unclear to what extent it is driven by differences in the sex hormone milieu . RESULTS from previous studies evaluating the effects of sex steroids on plasma TG homeostasis are inconclusive because they relied on orally administered synthetic hormone preparations or evaluated only plasma lipid concentrations but not kinetics . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemically delivered 17-estradiol , progesterone , and T on very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride ( VLDL-TG ) concentration and kinetics in postmenopausal women . VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were evaluated by using stable isotope-labeled tracer techniques in four groups of postmenopausal women ( n = 27 total ) who were studied before and after treatment with either 17-estradiol ( 0.1 mg/d via continuous delivery skin patch ) , progesterone ( 100 mg/d via vaginal insert ) and T ( 12.5 mg/d via skin gel ) , or no intervention ( control group ) . VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were unchanged in the control group and not altered by T and progesterone administration . Estradiol treatment , in contrast , reduced VLDL-TG concentration by approximately 30 % due to accelerated VLDL-TG plasma clearance ( 25.1 2.5 vs. 17.4 2.7 mL/min ; P < .01 ) . Estradiol , but not progesterone or T , is a major regulator of VLDL-TG metabolism .',\n",
       " ' Ombrabulin ( AVE8062 ) disrupts the vasculature of established tumours and has shown preclinical synergistic anti-tumour activity when combined with cisplatin . In this phase 3 trial , we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ombrabulin plus cisplatin compared with placebo plus cisplatin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas . We did this multinational , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 44 centres in ten countries . Patients aged 18 years and older with metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas , an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 , and who had previously received treatment with anthracycline and ifosfamide were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to intravenous infusion of ombrabulin 25 mg/m ( 2 ) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m ( 2 ) or intravenous infusion of placebo plus cisplatin 75 mg/m ( 2 ) every 3 weeks . Patients were allocated to treatment using a permuted blocks randomisation scheme ( block size of four ) via an interactive voice-response system , and stratified by histological subtype . Patients , medical staff , study investigators , and individuals who handled and analysed the data were masked to treatment assignment . Our primary endpoint was median progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population . Safety analyses were done on all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug . This trial is now closed , and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00699517 . Between June 13 , 2008 , and April 26 , 2012 , we randomly assigned 355 patients to ombrabulin plus cisplatin ( n = 176 ) or placebo plus cisplatin ( n = 179 ) . Median duration of follow-up was 279 ( IQR 209-332 ) in the placebo group and 305 months ( 207-376 ) in the ombrabulin group . Progression-free survival was slightly , but significantly , improved in the ombrabulin group compared with the placebo group ( median 154 months [ 95 % CI 145-269 ] vs 141 [ 138-158 ] months ; hazard ratio 076 [ 95 % CI 059-098 ] ; p = 00302 ) . Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred more frequently in individuals in the ombrabulin group than in those in the placebo group and included neutropenia ( 34 [ 19 % ] in the ombrabulin group vs 14 [ 8 % ] in the placebo group ) and thrombocytopenia ( 15 [ 8 % ] vs six [ 3 % ] for placebo ) . Adverse events leading to death occurred in 18 patients in the ombrabulin group and 10 patients in the placebo group . The combination of ombrabulin and cisplatin significantly improved progression-free survival ; however , it did not show a sufficient clinical benefit in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas to support its use as a therapeutic option . Predictive biomarkers are needed for the rational clinical development of tumour vascular-disrupting drugs for soft-tissue sarcomas . Sanofi .',\n",
       " ' To compare the curative effects of heat-sensitive moxibustion with conventional drugs on chronic persistent asthma and seek a valuable therapy to replace Western Medicine . The participants in this multi-center , randomized , and controlled study were randomly divided into two groups : group A ( n = 144 ) , treated with heat-sensitive moxibustion ( 50 sessions ) and group B ( n = 144 ) , treated with Seretide ( salmeterol 50 plg/fluticasone 250 pg , twice a day ) . The scores of asthma control test ( ACT ) , forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , and attack frequency were measured after 15 , 30 , 60 , and 90 days of treatment . Patients followed up 3 and 6 months after treatment . There was a significant difference ( P = 0.0002 ) in the ACT score and lung function between the two groups after 3 months of treatment and ( P = 0.000 03 ) during the follow-up visits . In addition , heat-sensitive moxibustion reduced attack frequency in the period from inclusion to the 6-month follow-up visit . This study shows that heat-sensitive moxibustion may have a comparable curative effect to Seretide ( salmetero/fluticasone ) on asthma .',\n",
       " ' To determine the efficacy of a custom-made wheelchair simulation in training children to use a powered wheelchair ( PWC ) . Randomized controlled trial employing the 4C/ID-model of learning . Twenty-eight typically developing children ( 13M , 15F ; mean age 6 years , SD 6 months ) were assessed on their operation of a PWC using a functional evaluation rating scale . Participants were randomly assigned to intervention ( 8 30-minute training sessions using a joystick operated wheelchair simulation ) or control conditions ( no task ) , and were reassessed on their PWC use after the intervention phase . Additional data from the simulation on completion times , errors , and total scores were recorded for the intervention group . Analysis of variance showed a main effect of time , with planned comparisons revealing a statistically significant change in PWC use for the intervention ( p = .022 ) but not the control condition . Although the intervention group showed greater improvement than the controls , this did not reach statistical significance . Multiple regression analyses showed that gender was predictive of pretest ( p = .005 ) functional ability . A simulated wheelchair task appears to be effective in helping children learn to operate a PWC . Greater attention should be given to female learners who underperformed when compared with their male counterparts . This low-cost intervention could be easily used at home to reduce PWC training times in children with motor disorders .',\n",
       " \" Aim of the study was to compare the chosen position of polyaxial locking screws with the position of monoaxial screws in the humeral head of proximal humeral fractures treated by locked plating . In a prospective randomized observational study , 124 consecutive patients ( mean age 70.914.8 years ) sustaining a displaced proximal humeral fracture were treated with either monoaxial or polyaxial screw-inserted locking plate fixation . The chosen positions of locking screws were identified from standardized postoperative radiographs in anteroposterior and outlet-view , with regard to a regional mapping of the humeral head . In monoaxial locking technique , a mean of 6 screws purchased the humeral head ( 95 % CI 5.1-6 .2 ) , and in polyaxial locking technique , a mean of 4 screws ( 95 % CI 3.3-4 .5 ) , respectively . Screws were placed in the regions superolateral : monoaxial 24.8 % , polyaxial 20.7 % ( p = 0.49 ) ; superomedial : monoaxial 21.9 % , polyaxial 20.0 % ( p = 0.433 ) ; inferolateral : monoaxial 32.5 % , polyaxial 35.0 % ( p = 0.354 ) ; inferomedial : monoaxial 20.8 % , polyaxial 24.2 % ( p = 0.07 ) , superoposterior : monoaxial 45.5 % , polyaxial 30.8 % ( p = 0.57 ) ; superoanterior : monoaxial 4.4 % , polyaxial 8.3 % ( p = 0.33 ) ; inferoposterior : monoaxial 22.5 % , polyaxial 29.8 % ( p = 0.49 ) and inferoanterior : monoaxial 27.5 % , polyaxial : 31.2 % ( p = 0.09 ) . The chosen screws ' position in monoaxial and polyaxial locking plate fixation of displaced proximal humeral fractures do not differ significantly . However , loss of fixation is observed more frequently if the fixation did not include at least one screw within the superoposterior region of the humeral head , suggesting that a screw purchasing the superoposterior region is beneficial in locked plating of proximal humeral fractures .

This was a single center , randomized , open label , examiner-blind , two-treatment , parallel group study . Subjects who met the entrance criteria were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the O-R or sonic treatment group . Subjects brushed with their assigned toothbrush and a marketed fluoride dentifrice for two minutes twice daily at home for 12 weeks . Gingivitis and plaque were evaluated at Baseline , Week 6 , and Week 12 . Gingivitis was assessed using the Modified Gingival Index ( MGI ) and Gingival Bleeding Index ( GBI ) , and plaque was assessed using the Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index ( RMNPI ) . Data were analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA ) with Baseline as the covariate . In total , 130 subjects ( 65 per group ) were randomized to treatment and 127 subjects completed the study . Both brushes produced statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) reductions in gingivitis and plaque measures relative to Baseline . At Week 12 , the O-R brush demonstrated significantly greater reductions than the sonic brush in whole mouth gingivitis measures ( p = 0.007 ) . Additionally , the O-R brush presented significantly fewer bleeding sites ( p < 0.007 ) and significantly greater reductions in whole mouth plaque measures ( p < or = 0.035 ) at Weeks 6 and 12 versus the sonic brush . The benefit for the O-R brush versus the sonic brush at Week 12 was 11.7 % for gingivitis , 19.8 % for number of bleeding sites , and 12.2 % for whole mouth plaque . There were no adverse events reported or observed for either brush . The oscillating-rotating toothbrush demonstrated statistically significantly greater reductions in whole mouth plaque at Weeks 6 and 12 , as well as significantly greater gingivitis reductions over the long-term ( 12 weeks ) , compared to the new sonic toothbrush .',\n",
       " ' The echocardiographic substudy of the OASIS-6 trial evaluated the prognostic implications of left ventricle ( LV ) systolic and diastolic dysfunction early postacute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) in patients treated with fondaparinux versus usual care . Comprehensive echocardiograms were performed a median of 6 days after the index STEMI in 528 patients , 258 randomized to fondaparinux and 270 to usual care ( unfractionated heparin or placebo ) , to assess LV systolic and diastolic function , LV mass , and LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes . A total of 245 ( 46.4 % ) patients were followed up for 3 months and 283 ( 53.6 % ) for 6 months . Major cardiac events ( MACE ) were defined as the composite of death , reinfarction , heart failure , or cardiogenic shock and resuscitated cardiac arrest . Patients with LV ejection fraction ( LVEF ) 45 % and restrictive diastolic function ( RDF ) were at greatly increased risk of MACE ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 8.85 , 95 % CI , 4.2118.60 ) compared to patients with LVEF 45 % and without RDF . RDF remained a strong predictor for MACE in patients with LVEF 45 % ( HR = 4.38 , 95 % CI , 1.5212.60 ) and in multivariate models adjusted for LVEF , LV end-systolic volume , and clinical variables . In this large international trial , LV systolic and diastolic function , as determined by echocardiography early following STEMI , are incremental predictors of MACE . In addition , RDF is a strong independent predictor of MACE after STEMI across a broad range of LVEF .',\n",
       " ' The self-reported health and functional status of persons with back pain in the United States have declined in recent years , despite greatly increased medical expenditures due to this problem . Although patient psychosocial factors such as pain-related beliefs , thoughts and coping behaviors have been demonstrated to affect how well patients respond to treatments for back pain , few patients receive treatments that address these factors . Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which addresses psychosocial factors , has been found to be effective for back pain , but access to qualified therapists is limited . Another treatment option with potential for addressing psychosocial issues , mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , is increasingly available . MBSR has been found to be helpful for various mental and physical conditions , but it has not been well-studied for application with chronic back pain patients . In this trial , we will seek to determine whether MBSR is an effective and cost-effective treatment option for persons with chronic back pain , compare its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared with CBT and explore the psychosocial variables that may mediate the effects of MBSR and CBT on patient outcomes . In this trial , we will randomize 397 adults with nonspecific chronic back pain to CBT , MBSR or usual care arms ( 99 per group ) . Both interventions will consist of eight weekly 2-hour group sessions supplemented by home practice . The MBSR protocol also includes an optional 6-hour retreat . Interviewers masked to treatment assignments will assess outcomes 5 , 10 , 26 and 52weeks postrandomization . The primary outcomes will be pain-related functional limitations ( based on the Roland Disability Questionnaire ) and symptom bothersomeness ( rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale ) at 26weeks . If MBSR is found to be an effective and cost-effective treatment option for patients with chronic back pain , it will become a valuable addition to the limited treatment options available to patients with significant psychosocial contributors to their pain .

       " \" Endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response have been recently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel diseases in adults . We aimed at assessing the involvement of these pathways also in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease by analysing the expression of the main genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and correlating them with the degree of intestinal inflammation . Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis of the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker HSPA5 and of selected genes representing the three pathways of unfolded protein response ( IRE-XBP1 , PERK-ATF4 , ATF6p90-p50 ) in inflamed and uninflamed biopsies from 28 inflammatory bowel disease paediatric patients and 10 controls . HSPA5 , PDIA4 , as well as unspliced and spliced XBP1 mRNAs were significantly increased in patients ' inflamed colonic mucosa compared to uninflamed mucosa and controls . HSPA5 , PDIA4 , ATF6 , and phospho-IRE proteins were also upregulated , indicating the activation of the IRE-XBP1 and ATF6p90-p50 branches of unfolded protein response . A positive significant correlation between interleukin-8 levels , as a marker of inflammation , and upregulated genes was found in the inflamed colonic mucosa . A deregulation of the genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response pathways may be a key component of the inflammatory response in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease .\",\n",

Half of the 75 - to 76-year-old population in 2 Swedish regions were invited to a screening program for AF . Participants without a previous diagnosis of AF underwent intermittent ECG recordings over 2 weeks . If AF was detected , participants were offered OAC . During the 28-month inclusion period , 13331 inhabitants were invited . Of these , 7173 ( 53.8 % ) participated . Of the participants , 218 ( 3.0 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.7-3 .5 ) were found to have previously unknown AF , and of these , AF was found in 37 ( 0.5 % of the screened population ) on their first ECG . The use of intermittent ECGs increased new AF detection 4-fold . A previous diagnosis of AF was known in 9.3 % ( n = 666 ; 95 % CI , 8.6-10 .0 ) . Total AF prevalence in the screened population was 12.3 % . Of participants with known AF , 149 ( 2.1 % ; 95 % CI , 1.8-2 .4 ) had no OAC treatment . In total , 5.1 % ( 95 % CI , 4.6-5 .7 ) of the screened population had untreated AF ; screening resulted in initiation of OAC treatment in 3.7 % ( 95 % CI , 3.3-4 .2 ) of the screened population . More than 90 % of the participants with previously undiagnosed AF accepted initiation of OAC treatment .

The primary end point was incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse . Secondary end points included progression-free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . The study was terminated early with 540 enrolled patients ( 271 received lapatinib-capecitabine , and 269 received trastuzumab-capecitabine ) . Incidence of CNS metastases as first site of relapse was 3 % ( eight of 251 patients ) for lapatinib-capecitabine and 5 % ( 12 of 250 patients ) for trastuzumab-capecitabine ( treatment differences , -1.6 % ; 95 % CI , -2 % to 5 % ; P = .360 ) . PFS and OS were longer with trastuzumab-capecitabine versus lapatinib-capecitabine ( hazard ratio [ HR ] for PFS , 1.30 ; 95 % CI , 1.04 to 1.64 ; HR for OS , 1.34 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 to 1.64 ) . Serious adverse events were reported in 13 % ( 34 of 269 patients ) and 17 % ( 45 of 267 patients ) of patients in the lapatinib-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine arms , respectively . CEREBEL is inconclusive for the primary end point , and no difference was detected between lapatinb-capecitabine and trastuzumab-capecitabine for the incidence of CNS metastases . A better outcome was observed with trastuzumab-capecitabine in the overall population . However , lapatinib-capecitabine efficacy may have been affected by previous exposure to a trastuzumab regimen and/or when treatment was given as first - or second-line therapy in the metastatic setting .',\n",
       " ' Factors underlying differential responsiveness to opioid analgesic medications used in chronic pain management are poorly understood . We tested whether individual differences in endogenous opioid inhibition of chronic low-back pain were associated with the magnitude of acute reductions in back pain ratings after morphine administration . In randomized counterbalanced order over three sessions , 50 chronic low-back pain patients received intravenous naloxone ( 8 mg ) , morphine ( 0.08 mg/kg ) , or placebo . Back pain intensity was rated predrug and again after peak drug activity was achieved using the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form ( Sensory and Affective subscales , VAS Intensity measure ) . Opioid blockade effect measures to index degree of endogenous opioid inhibition of back pain intensity were derived as the difference between predrug to postdrug changes in pain intensity across placebo and naloxone conditions , with similar morphine responsiveness measures derived across placebo and morphine conditions . Morphine significantly reduced back pain compared with placebo ( McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form Sensory , VAS ; P < 0.01 ) . There were no overall effects of opioid blockade on back pain intensity . However , individual differences in opioid blockade effects were significantly associated with the degree of acute morphine-related reductions in back pain on all measures , even after controlling for effects of age , sex , and chronic pain duration ( P < 0.03 ) . Individuals exhibiting greater endogenous opioid inhibition of chronic back pain intensity reported less acute relief of back pain with morphine . Morphine appears to provide better acute relief of chronic back pain in individuals with lower natural opioidergic inhibition of chronic pain intensity . Possible implications for personalized medicine are discussed .',\n",
       " \" The purpose of this study was to examine a dynamic assessment with graduated prompts to assess morphological awareness and determine whether such a task was related to third-grade literacy success . A dynamic assessment of morphological awareness was adapted and administered to 54 third-grade students in addition to a norm-referenced language and literacy battery . A dynamic assessment of morphological awareness measured a range of performance including that of emerging morphological awareness abilities and provided rich linguistic insights for how best to scaffold and prompt for such a skill . In addition , the dynamic morphological awareness measure was found to be significantly related to , and to contribute unique variance to , reading comprehension abilities . These results suggest that morphological awareness is an important factor to consider when addressing students ' literacy performance in early elementary school and that dynamic assessment appears to be a clinically valuable tool when examining early morphological awareness abilities .\",\n",

A prospective , randomised study was performed on 394 patients treated for esophageal cancer between January 2006 and December 2010 . The trial registry number is ChiCTR-TRC-13003817 in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry . Anastomotic leaks occurred in four patients in group A ( 2.1 % ) and in twelve patients in group B ( 6.2 % ) with statistically significant ( P = 0.038 ) . During the evaluation of benign stricture seven patients were excluded for hospital mortality . Thirty three patients in group A ( 6.9 % ) and 25 patients in group B ( 13.2 % ) occurred anastomotic stricture respectively ( P = 0.044 ) . Furthermore , reflux oesophagitis and Barrett 's epithelium were found in 105 patients ( 55.3 % ) of group B , and 54 ( 28.7 % ) patients in group A ( P < 0.001 ) .

       " ' Ultrasound-guided long-axis in-plane sciatic perineural catheter insertion has been described but not validated . For the popliteal-sciatic nerve , we hypothesized that a long-axis in-plane technique , placing the catheter parallel and posterior to the nerve , results in faster onset of sensory anesthesia compared to a short-axis in-plane technique . Preoperatively , patients receiving a popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter were randomly assigned to either the long-axis or short-axis technique . Mepivacaine 2 % was administered via the catheter following insertion . The primary outcome was time to achieve complete sensory anesthesia . Secondary outcomes included procedural time , onset time of motor block , and pain on postoperative day 1 . Fifty patients were enrolled . In the long-axis group ( n = 25 ) , all patients except 1 ( 4 % ) had successful catheter placement per protocol . Two patients ( 8 % ) in the long-axis group and 1 patient ( 4 % ) in the short-axis group ( n = 25 ) did not achieve sensory anesthesia by 30 min and were withdrawn . Seventeen of 24 ( 71 % ) and 17 of 22 ( 77 % ) patients in the short-axis and long-axis groups , respectively , achieved the primary outcome of complete sensory anesthesia ( p = 0.589 ) . The short-axis group ( n = 17 ) required a median ( 10th-90th ) of 18.0 ( 8.4-30 .0 ) min compared to 18.0 ( 11.4-27 .6 ) min for the long-axis group ( n = 17 , p = 0.208 ) to achieve complete sensory anesthesia . Procedural time was 6.5 ( 4.0-12 .0 ) min for the short-axis and 9.5 ( 7.0-12 .7 ) min for the long-axis ( p < 0.001 ) group .

       " ' Although the analgesic effect of periarticular injection after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) has been well documented , the gold standard for drug combination has not yet been established . In this study , the analgesic effects of six different drug combinations were compared . A total of 256 patients undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis were randomized into one of six groups : a control group ( saline solution , epinephrine , and cefazolin , n = 42 ) , Group 1 ( ropivacaine , n = 43 ) , Group 2 ( ropivacaine + morphine , n = 43 ) , Group 3 ( ropivacaine + ketorolac , n = 42 ) , Group 4 ( ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac , n = 43 ) , and Group 5 ( ropivacaine + morphine + ketorolac + methylprednisolone , n = 43 ) . Pain level assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and opioid consumption were primary outcomes . The incidence of complications , range of motion ( ROM ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) value , and the amount of post-operative blood drainage were also compared . Patients in Groups 4 and 5 complained less pain than the control group for the first 12 h after surgery , and the patients in the other groups showed less pain only during the initial 6 h after surgery . Groups 4 and 5 also showed less opioid consumption than the control group during the 24 h period after surgery . Patients in Group 5 showed no significant difference in VAS score and opioid consumption compared with Group 4 , but they had lower CRP value and greater ROM than any other groups at post-operative day 2 and day 4 . The combination of ropivacaine , morphine , and ketorolac showed a significantly stronger and sufficiently synergistic analgesic effect without adding methylprednisolone in periarticular injection after TKA . The clinical relevance of the study is that the combination of ropivacaine , morphine , and ketorolac can be a good option for periarticular injection following TKA in terms of synergistic analgesic effect and efficiency of drug combination .',\n",

At week 12 , patients achieving 75 % or more improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score ( PASI 75 ) were rerandomized to 2 dose levels of secukinumab retreatment as needed ( n = 217 , 300 mg ; n = 206 , 150 mg ) or fixed interval ( n = 217 ; n = 203 ) . Primary end point was noninferiority of retreatment as needed versus fixed interval for maintaining PASI 75 to week 52 . Secukinumab induced high responses by week 12 ( 84.4 % -91.1 % PASI 75 responders ) . From week 12 to week 52 , more patients on fixed interval ( 78.2 % , 300 mg ; 62.1 % , 150 mg ) maintained PASI 75 versus retreatment as needed ( 67.7 % ; 52.4 % ) ; statistical noninferiority of retreatment as needed was not established . Overall safety , including very low incidences of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies ( < 0.5 % ) , was similar between regimens . The primary end point was developed without any known precedent . Secukinumab fixed interval showed clear benefit versus the study-specified retreatment-as-needed regimen for maintaining efficacy . Both regimens exhibited safety consistent with previous trials . The potential of retreatment as needed with secukinumab warrants further investigation .',\n",
       " \" The purpose of this study was to quantify the frequency and clinical severity of quality deficiencies in intensity modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) planning in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0126 protocol . A total of 219 IMRT patients from the high-dose arm ( 79.2 Gy ) of RTOG 0126 were analyzed . To quantify plan quality , we used established knowledge-based methods for patient-specific dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) prediction of organs at risk and a Lyman-Kutcher-Burman ( LKB ) model for grade 2 rectal complications to convert DVHs into normal tissue complication probabilities ( NTCPs ) . The LKB model was validated by fitting dose-response parameters relative to observed toxicities . The 90th percentile ( 22 of 219 ) of plans with the lowest excess risk ( difference between clinical and model-predicted NTCP ) were used to create a model for the presumed best practices in the protocol ( pDVH0126 , top10 % ) . Applying the resultant model to the entire sample enabled comparisons between DVHs that patients could have received to DVHs they actually received . Excess risk quantified the clinical impact of suboptimal planning . Accuracy of pDVH predictions was validated by replanning 30 of 219 patients ( 13.7 % ) , including equal numbers of presumed `` high-quality , '' `` low-quality , '' and randomly sampled plans . NTCP-predicted toxicities were compared to adverse events on protocol . Existing models showed that bladder-sparing variations were less prevalent than rectum quality variations and that increased rectal sparing was not correlated with target metrics ( dose received by 98 % and 2 % of the PTV , respectively ) . Observed toxicities were consistent with current LKB parameters . Converting DVH and pDVH0126 , top10 % to rectal NTCPs , we observed 94 of 219 patients ( 42.9 % ) with 5 % excess risk , 20 of 219 patients ( 9.1 % ) with 10 % excess risk , and 2 of 219 patients ( 0.9 % ) with 15 % excess risk . Replanning demonstrated the predicted NTCP reductions while maintaining the volume of the PTV receiving prescription dose . An equivalent sample of high-quality plans showed fewer toxicities than low-quality plans , 6 of 73 versus 10 of 73 respectively , although these differences were not significant ( P = .21 ) due to insufficient statistical power in this retrospective study . Plan quality deficiencies in RTOG 0126 exposed patients to substantial excess risk for rectal complications .\",\n",
       " ' Transfer patterns , procedure rates , and outcomes of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) presenting to Canadian community hospitals are not well understood . We documented all patients admitted to British Columbia ( BC ) hospitals with a primary diagnosis of NSTEMI between 2007 and 2008 . Patients were divided by admitting hospital type into tertiary care hospitals , nonremote community hospitals , and remote community hospitals . The aims were to compare transfer rates and time to transfer to a tertiary hospital as well as procedure rates and outcomes at index admission , at 30 days , and at 1 year . The mean transfer rates to a tertiary hospital were 72.6 % for nonremote and 57.1 % for remote community hospitals ( P < 0.001 ) . Times to and rates of cardiac procedures differed significantly among these 3 hospital types . Admission to a nonremote or remote community hospital was associated with similar 1-year mortality compared with admission to a tertiary care hospital ( nonremote hospitals , adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.87 ; P = 0.26 ; remote hospitals , adjusted OR , 1.19 ; P = 0.33 ) . At 1 year , admission to a nonremote community hospital was associated with a lower composite outcome of death or readmission for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) ( adjusted OR , 0.80 ; P = 0.04 ) . One-year mortality rates were not different between patients with NSTEMI admitted to BC community and tertiary care hospitals ; however , the rate of readmission for AMI/death was significantly less in patients admitted to nonremote community hospitals . This should prompt the evaluation of key outcomes in NSTEMI in other community hospital settings .',\n",

This multicentre randomised controlled trial aimed to determine whether preformed foot orthoses ( FOs ) impacted on pain and quality of life ( QoL ) in children with JIA . Eligible children were randomised to receive either ` fitted ' FOs with customised chair-side corrections or ` control ' FOs made without corrections . Changes in pain and QoL were measured using a visual analogue scale and Paediatric Quality of Life questionnaire , respectively . JIA children were assessed at baseline , 3 months and 6 months . 60 children were recruited . 179 out of a possible 180 assessments ( 99.4 % ) were completed . A statistically significant greater difference in pain reduction ( baseline - 6 months ) was seen between the two groups favouring fitted FOs ( p = 0.029 ) . The reduction in pain in the fitted FOs group was clinically important ( 8 mm ) . Significant differences in QoL favouring fitted FOs were also identified as measured by the children and independently by their parents/carers . Fitted FOs may reduce pain and improve QoL in selected children with JIA . NCT02001844 .\",\n",
       " \" Edgewise fixed orthodontic appliances are available in two different bracket slot sizes ( 0.018 and 0.022 inch ) . Both systems are used by clinicians worldwide with some orthodontists claiming the superiority and clinical advantages of one system over the other . However , the scientific evidence supporting this area is scarce and weak . This leaves the clinician 's choice of bracket slot system to clinical preference . We aim to compare the 0.018-inch and 0.022-inch pre-adjusted bracket slot systems in terms of the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment . This is a prospective , multicenter , randomized clinical trial , undertaken in the secondary care hospital environment in the NHS Tayside region of Scotland ( United Kingdom ) . A total of 216 orthodontic patients will be recruited in three centers in secondary care hospitals in NHS Tayside . The participants will be randomly allocated to treatment with either the 0.018-inch or 0.022-inch bracket slot systems ( n = 108 for each group ) using Victory series conventional pre-adjusted bracket systems ( 3 M Unitek , Monrovia , United States ) . Baseline records and outcome data collected during and at the end of orthodontic treatment will be assessed . The primary outcome measures will be the duration of orthodontic treatment in the maxillary and mandibular arches . The secondary outcome measures will be the number of scheduled appointments for orthodontic treatment in the maxillary and mandibular arches , treatment outcome using Peer Assessment Rating index ( PAR ) , orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption ( as measured using periapical radiographs ) and the patient 's perception of wearing orthodontic appliances . The results from the current study will serve as evidence to guide the clinician in deciding whether the difference in bracket slot size has a significant impact on the effectiveness of orthodontic treatment .

       " ' Compare the effectiveness of Papacarie gel for the chemo-mechanical removal of carious lesions on primary teeth to conventional caries removal with a low-speed bur with regard to execution time , clinical aspects and radiographic findings . A randomized controlled clinical trial with a split-mouth design was carried out . The sample was composed of 20 children aged four to seven years , in whom 40 deciduous teeth were randomly divided into two groups : chemo-mechanical caries removal with Papacarie and removal of carious dentin with a low-speed bur . Each child underwent both procedures and served as his/her own control . Restorations were performed with glass ionomer cement . The time required to perform the procedure was also analyzed . The patients underwent longitudinal clinical and radiographic follow-up of the restorations . No statistically significant difference between groups was found regarding the time required to perform the procedures and the radiographic follow up . Statistically significant differences between groups were found in the clinical evaluation at 6 and 18 months after treatment . Papacarie is as effective as the traditional method for the removal of carious dentin on deciduous teeth , but offers the advantages of the preservation of sound dental tissue as well as the avoidance of sharp rotary instruments and local anesthesia .',\n",

       " ' Treatment options for plantar fasciitis have resulted in varied patient outcomes . The aim of this study was to compare a novel treatment , cryopreserved human amniotic membrane ( c-hAM ) , to a traditional treatment , corticosteroid . Our hypothesis was that c-hAM would be safe and comparable to corticosteroids for plantar fasciitis in regard to patient outcomes . A randomized , controlled , double-blind , single-center pilot study was completed . Patients were randomized into one of 2 treatment groups : c-hAM or corticosteroid . Patients received an injection at their initial baseline visit with an option for a second injection at their first 6-week follow-up . Total follow-up was obtained for 12 weeks after the most recent injection . The primary outcome measurement was the Foot Health Status Questionnaire ( FHSQ ) . The secondary outcome measurements were the Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) and verbally reported percentage improvement . Data were analyzed between groups for the 2 different cohorts ( 1 injection versus 2 injections ) . Twenty-three patients had complete follow-up . Fourteen were randomized to receive corticosteroid and 9 were randomized to receive c-hAM . Three patients in each group received second injections . With the numbers available , the majority of outcome measurements showed no statistical difference between groups . The corticosteroid did , however , have greater FHSQ shoe fit improvement ( P = .0244 ) at 6 weeks , FHSQ general health improvement ( P = .0132 ) at 6 weeks , and verbally reported improvement ( P = .041 ) at 12 weeks in the one-injection cohort . Cryopreserved hAM had greater FHSQ foot pain improvement ( P = .0113 ) at 18 weeks in the 2-injection cohort . Cryopreserved hAM injection may be safe and comparable to corticosteroid injection for treatment of plantar fasciitis . This is a pilot study and requires further investigation .

       " ' Placing a central venous access device via the internal jugular or subclavian vein entails significant risks to both patient and healthcare worker . The purpose of this randomized , prospective study was to determine whether the accelerated Seldinger technique ( AST ) offers significant safety advantages over the modified Seldinger technique ( MST ) for peripherally inserted central catheter insertion . Patients were randomly assigned to undergo introducer sheath insertion by means of either MST or AST . Primary outcome measures included time to completion of introducer sheath insertion , estimated blood loss , and success rate . Secondary outcome measures included vessel-to-air exposure events and unprotected sharps exposure . While both insertion methods proved equivalent for successful vessel cannulation , AST was significantly faster ( P = 0.0048 ) and resulted in less blood loss ( P = 0.0295 ) than MST . Additionally , AST resulted in significantly fewer vessel-to-air exposure events ( P < 0.0001 ) and unprotected sharps exposures ( P < 0.0001 ) . Although this was a relatively small and unblinded study , the high degree of statistical significance of the study results suggests that , for both patients and healthcare workers , AST is faster and safer than MST for PICC peelable introducer sheath insertion .',\n",
       " ' A significant proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond adequately to biologic treatment . We hypothesized that lack of response to ( biologic ) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) is high in patients in whom the subjective , patient-reported component of the Disease Activity Score 28 ( DAS28 ) is high at baseline . The primary aim of our present study was to investigate the contribution of the more subjective versus the objective components of the DAS28 to response to biologic agents in RA patients , as well as the changes in this contribution over time . The secondary aim was to examine whether the value of this subjective contribution at baseline affects the response to treatment . The DAS28-P ( the subjective components of the DAS28 relative to the total DAS28 ) was calculated . Patients were derived from the computer-assisted Management in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Trial-II and the Biologicals and Outcome Compared and Predicted in Utrecht Region in Rheumatoid Arthritis Study . Ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed . The DAS28-P score at baseline was not associated with the level of response according to European League Against Rheumatism criteria at 3 months . Overall , a significant reduction in the DAS28-P score was observed 3 months after start of treatment , showing a greater reduction of the combined subjective components in good responders . The results reject the hypothesis that the lack of response to biologic DMARDs is especially high in patients in whom the patient-reported component of the DAS28 is high at baseline ; these subjective components are not linked to treatment response .',\n",
       " ' Coordination between breathing and swallowing helps prevent aspiration of foreign material into the respiratory tract . The authors examined the effects of anesthesia and hypercapnia on swallowing-breathing coordination . In a randomized controlled crossover study , general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using an up-down method to identify the threshold for suppression of the motor response to electrical stimulation of the forearm . Additional measurements included bispectral index , genioglossus electromyogram , ventilation ( pneumotachometer ) , and hypopharyngeal pressure . During wakefulness and at each level of anesthesia , carbon dioxide was added to increase the end-tidal pressure by 4 and 8 mmHg . A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure . Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological ( during expiration or followed by expiration ) or pathological ( during inspiration or followed by an inspiration ) . A total of 224 swallows were analyzed . Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows ( 25.9 % vs. 4.9 % ) and decreased the number of swallows per hour ( 1.73.3 vs. 28.022.3 ) compared to wakefulness . During anesthesia , hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration ( -14.13.7 vs. -8.72 mmHg ) and increased minute ventilation , the proportion of pathological swallows ( 19.1 % vs. 12.3 % ) , and the number of swallows per hour ( 5.517.0 . vs. 1.35.5 ) . Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration . Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing . During anesthesia , the risk for aspiration may be further increased when ventilatory drive is stimulated .',\n",
       " ' In ruminants , lower ruminal pH causes massive disruption of ruminal epithelial structure during periods of feeding high-concentrate diets . However , the influence of excessive organic fatty acids in the lumen of hindgut on the epithelial structure is unclear . In this study , twelve mid-lactating goats were randomly assigned to either a HC diet group ( 65 % concentrate of dry matter ; n = 6 ) or a LC diet group ( 35 % concentrate of dry matter ; n = 6 ) for 10 weeks . The colonic epithelial structure was detected by HE staining and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and the apoptotic status of epithelial cells was estimated by TUNEL method and caspase activities . HC goats showed higher level of free lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in rumen fluid ( p < 0.01 ) but not in colonic digesta ( p > 0.05 ) , and higher total volatile fatty acid ( VFA ) concentrations in rumen fluid ( p < 0.05 ) and in colonic digesta ( p < 0.01 ) , and higher content of starch in colonic digesta ( p < 0.05 ) compared to LC goats . HC goats demonstrated profound alterations in the colonic epithelial structure and tight junctions ( TJ ) , apparently due to damage of the epithelium with widened TJs space and nuclear breakdown and mitochondrial swelling . HC goats showed higher level of apoptosis in the colonic epithelium with higher proportion of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and increases of caspase-3 and -3 / 7 activities , as well as the lower ratio of bcl-2 / bax mRNA expression in the colonic mucosa ( p < 0.05 ) . However , - defense mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa of HC goats compared to LC ( p < 0.05 ) . HC goats showed higher level of TJ proteins including claudin-1 and claudin-4 in the colonic mucosa than LC ( p < 0.05 ) . Neither free LPS content in the colonic digesta nor NF - B protein expression in tissues showed significant difference between HC and LC goats ( p > 0.05 ) . Our results reveal that long-term feeding HC diet to lactating goats causes severe damages to the colonic mucosa barrier associated with activating cells apoptosis .',\n",

HCV RNAs were detected at baseline , and weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 48 and 72 using Cobas TaqMan . ARCHITECT HCVcAg was performed at 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 and 144 h in addition to the above time points . The receiver operating curves ( ROCs ) were performed to study the predictive values of HCVcAg decline on SVR . Following antiviral treatment , serum HCVcAg levels rapidly declined within the first week and correlated well with corresponding HCV RNA at baseline , weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 48 and 72 ( rs = 0.969 , 0.928 , 0.999 , 0.983 , 0.985 and 0.946 , respectively , P < 0.001 ) . All of the areas under the receiver operating curves ( AUROCs ) were more than 0.80 and showed good predictive power on SVR at 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 and 144 h. The144 h was the best predictive time point of HCVcAg decline on SVR because of its largest AUROC ( more than 0.90 ) . Early kinetics of serum HCVcAg predicts SVR very well in genotype 1 CHC patients during antiviral treatment , and its reduction value at 144 h is an earlier and stronger predictor on SVR than rapid virological response and early virological response .

Sixty patients who were suffering from nasal obstruction and who had to undergo septoplasty because of nasal septal deviation were included in the study . After the septoplasty , Merocel packings and internal nasal splints were intraoperatively applied in thirty patients each . Middle ear pressure was evaluated by tympanometry . Tympanometric peak pressures were used for this aim . Acoustic impedance measurements were performed in both ears , and the average values of the two ears were calculated . Tympanometric measurements were performed for patients during the preoperative period and on the 2 ( nd ) and 5 ( th ) postoperative days . There were 30 ( 5 females , 25 males ; average age 23 years ) patients in the internal nasal splint group and 30 ( 8 females , 22 males ; average age 26 years ) patients in the anterior Merocel packing group . When the values obtained by acoustic impedancemetry before the operation and on the postoperative 5 ( th ) day were compared , there was no statistically significant difference between the groups . The middle ear pressure significantly decreased in the anterior Merocel packing group compared with that in the internal nasal splint group . The intragroup comparison of the acoustic impedance measurements of the internal nasal splint group revealed no significant difference between the preoperative acoustic impedance values and the values obtained on the postoperative 2 ( nd ) day .

       " \" Verbal autopsy ( VA ) has been proposed to determine the cause of death ( COD ) distributions in settings where most deaths occur without medical attention or certification . We develop performance criteria for VA-based COD systems and apply these to the Registrar General of India 's ongoing , nationally-representative Indian Million Death Study ( MDS ) . Performance criteria include a low ill-defined proportion of deaths before old age ; reproducibility , including consistency of COD distributions with independent resampling ; differences in COD distribution of hospital , home , urban or rural deaths ; age - , sex - and time-specific plausibility of specific diseases ; stability and repeatability of dual physician coding ; and the ability of the mortality classification system to capture a wide range of conditions . The introduction of the MDS in India reduced the proportion of ill-defined deaths before age 70 years from 13 % to 4 % . The cause-specific mortality fractions ( CSMFs ) at ages 5 to 69 years for independently resampled deaths and the MDS were very similar across 19 disease categories . By contrast , CSMFs at these ages differed between hospital and home deaths and between urban and rural deaths . Thus , reliance mostly on urban or hospital data can distort national estimates of CODs . Age - , sex - and time-specific patterns for various diseases were plausible . Initial physician agreement on COD occurred about two-thirds of the time . The MDS COD classification system was able to capture more eligible records than alternative classification systems . By these metrics , the Indian MDS performs well for deaths prior to age 70 years . The key implication for low - and middle-income countries where medical certification of death remains uncommon is to implement COD surveys that randomly sample all deaths , use simple but high-quality field work with built-in resampling , and use electronic rather than paper systems to expedite field work and coding . Simple criteria can evaluate the performance of VA-based COD systems . Despite the misclassification of VA , the MDS demonstrates that national surveys of CODs using VA are an order of magnitude better than the limited COD data previously available .\",\n",
       " ' Depression accounts for the greatest disease burden of all mental health disorders , contributes heavily to healthcare costs , and by 2020 is set to become the second largest cause of global disability . Although 10 % to 16 % of people aged 65 years and over are likely to experience depressive symptoms , the condition is under-diagnosed and often inadequately treated in primary care . Later-life depression is associated with chronic illness and disability , cognitive impairment and social isolation . With a progressively ageing population it becomes increasingly important to refine strategies to identity and manage depression in older people . Currently , management may be limited to the prescription of antidepressants where there may be poor concordance ; older people may lack awareness of psychosocial interventions and general practitioners may neglect to offer this treatment option . CASPER Plus is a multi-centre , randomised controlled trial of a collaborative care intervention for individuals aged 65 years and over experiencing moderate to severe depression . Selected practices in the North of England identify potentially eligible patients and invite them to participate in the study . A diagnostic interview is carried out and participants with major depressive disorder are randomised to either collaborative care or usual care . The recruitment target is 450 participants . The intervention , behavioural activation and medication management in a collaborative care framework , has been adapted to meet the complex needs of older people . It is delivered over eight to 10 weekly sessions by a case manager liaising with general practitioners . The trial aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of collaborative care in addition to usual GP care versus usual GP care alone . The primary clinical outcome , depression severity , will be measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) at baseline , 4 , 12 and 18 months . Cost effectiveness analysis will assess health-related quality of life using the SF-12 and EQ-5D and will examine cost-consequences of collaborative care . A qualitative process evaluation will be undertaken to explore acceptability , gauge the extent to which the intervention is implemented and to explore sustainability beyond the clinical trial . Results will add to existing evidence and a positive outcome may lead to the commissioning of this model of service in primary care . ISRCTN45842879 ( 24 July 2012 ) .',\n",

This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the obstructive component of biliary radioactive stents and discuss the different obstructive mechanism with common plastic stents . Twenty consecutive patients with malignant obstruction underwent insertion of stents into the common bile duct , including 10 radioactive stents and 10 polyethylene stents . The radioactive stents were withdrawn after 3 months or earlier if clinical signs suggested stent clogging . Polyethylene stents were withdrawn after physical signs suggested stent clogging . Bacteriologic analyses included identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria . Stent surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy . Stent deposition was identified by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis derivatization/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry . Radioactive stent group and polyethylene stent group stents were placed for 86 days ( interquartile range 62 , 114 ) and 146 days ( interquartile range 105 , 181 ) respectively . The placement duration of the two types of stents was statistically significant . A variety of microorganisms were cultured from the stent deposits . Scanning electron microscope images showed a thicker necrotic layer on the external surface of polyethylene stent than the radioactive stent group . The proportions of obstructive components in each stent were different , but none of them were statistically significant . Necrotic tumor tissue was found in the radioactive stent group . Similar clogging events occurred in both radioactive stents and polyethylene stents . The median duration time of the radioactive stent was shorter , probably because of the smaller inner diameter , and the radioactive seeds exerted no beneficial effect in inhibiting microorganisms .',\n",
       " ' Previous studies on cognitive and interpersonal interventions have yielded inconsistent results in ischemic heart disease patients . 101 patients aged 70 years , and enrolled one week after complete revascularization with urgent/emergent angioplasty for an AMI , were randomized to standard cardiological therapy plus short-term humanistic-existential psychotherapy ( STP ) versus standard cardiological therapy only . Primary composite end point was : one-year incidence of new cardiological events ( re-infarction , death , stroke , revascularization , life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias , and the recurrence of typical and clinically significant angina ) and of clinically significant new comorbidities . Secondary end points were : rates for individual components of the primary outcome , incidence of re-hospitalizations for cardiological problems , New York Heart Association class , and psychometric test scores at follow-up . 94 patients were analyzed at one year . The two treatment groups were similar across all baseline characteristics . At follow-up , STP patients had had a lower incidence of the primary endpoint , relative to controls ( 21/49 vs. 35/45 patients ; p = 0.0006 , respectively ; NNT = 3 ) ; this benefit was attributable to the lower incidence of recurrent angina and of new comorbidities in the STP group ( 14/49 vs. 22/45 patients , p = 0.04 , NNT = 5 ; and 5/49 vs. 25/45 , p < 0.0001 , NNT = 3 , respectively ) . Patients undergoing STP also had statistically fewer re-hospitalizations , a better NYHA class , higher quality of life , and lower depression scores . Adding STP to cardiological therapy improves cardiological symptoms , quality of life , and psychological and medical outcomes one year post AMI , while reducing the need for re-hospitalizations . Larger studies remain necessary to confirm the generalizability of these results . ClinicalTrial.gov : NCT00769366 .',\n",
       " ' Noroviruses are the most important viral causes of gastroenteritis-related morbidity and mortality . A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluated an adjuvanted bivalent intramuscular norovirus virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine . Forty-eight adults aged 18-49 years received either 2 doses containing genotype GI .1 VLP and a consensus GII .4 VLP or 2 doses of placebo . Doses ( 5 g , 15 g , 50 g , or 150 g of each VLP ) were administered 4 weeks apart in the first stage . Subsequently , 54 adults , aged 18-49 ( n = 16 ) , 50-64 ( n = 19 ) , and 65-85 ( n = 19 ) years , received 2 doses of vaccine containing 50 g of each VLP . Total and class-specific antibody responses , as well as histoblood group antigen ( HBGA ) blocking antibody responses , were measured before and after each dose . Local reactions were mainly injection site pain/tenderness , with no reported fever or vaccine-related serious adverse events . One dose of vaccine containing 50 g of each VLP increased GI .1 geometric mean titers ( GMTs ) by 118-fold , 83-fold , and 24-fold and increased GII .4 GMTs by 49-fold , 25-fold , and 9-fold in subjects aged 18-49 , 50-64 , and 65-83 years , respectively . Serum antibody responses peaked at day 7 after the first dose , with no evidence of boosting following a second dose . Most subjects achieved HBGA-blocking antibody titers of 200 . The vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic . Rapid immune response to a single dose may be particularly useful in military personnel and travelers and in the control of outbreaks .

       " ' The threshold values of rapid shallow breathing index ( RSBI ) were compared in pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) and T-piece assessments for spontaneous breathing trials ( SBT ) . The ability of RSBI to also predict successful weaning was evaluated . Two hundred eight patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation through oral intubation . They were randomly divided into PSV group ( n = 93 ) and T-piece group ( n = 115 ) . The RSBI was calculated as f/VT at SBT of 3 and 30 minutes . Receiver operating characteristic curves of RSBI were also generated , cutoff values were determined and the changes in the RSBI were calculated . Of the 208 patients , 168 ( 80.77 % ) were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation , 78/93 ( 83.9 % ) in the PSV group and 90/115 ( 78.3 % ) in the T-piece group ( P > 0.05 ) . In the PSV and T-piece groups , the average RSBI at 30-minute SBT was 67.18 11.55 breaths per min/L and 99.11 15.53 breaths per min/L , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) , and the average RSBI was 69 33 % and 119 35 % , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) . Additionally , in the 2 groups , an RSBI of 75 breaths per min/L ( PSV ) and 100 breaths per min/L ( T-piece ) yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 87 % and 82 % respectively . However , a RSBI of 90 % ( PSV ) and 130 % ( T-piece ) yielded a diagnostic accuracy of 82 % and 77 % respectively . The threshold values of RSBI , thus 75 breaths per min/L ( PSV ) and 100 breaths per min/L ( T-piece ) , for predicting successful weaning were more accurate than other values . Similarly , the change in the RSBI could also predict such successes .',\n",
       " ' Continuous long-term treatment with nitrates may cause nitrate tolerance . Nebivolol is a highly selective beta1-adrenergic antagonist with additional nitric oxide ( NO ) - mediated vasodilatory effects . However , there have been no investigations into whether or not the long-term administration of nebivolol might cause nitrate tolerance . We performed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study in 16 healthy men . Subjects received 5 mg nebivolol or placebo once daily for 8 days in random order divided by a drug-free interval of 2 weeks . Forearm blood flow ( FBF ) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography 3 h after oral intake of the first and last doses of nebivolol and placebo , respectively . FBF was measured again following the intravenous administration of 4 g nitroglycerin/kg body weight/min for 5 min . Following 8 days of continuous intake of placebo , nitroglycerin increased FBF by 54 % ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas nitroglycerin increased FBF by 96 % ( p < 0.01 ) following 8 days of continuous intake of nebivolol , and the increase after 8 days of nebivolol was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) more pronounced than after 8 days of placebo . These findings indicate no evidence of nitrate tolerance caused by long-term administration of nebivolol . On the contrary , long-term intake of nebivolol increases rather than decreases the NO-mediated vasodilating effects .',\n",

Although the preoperative and intraoperative antibiotic management of acute calculous cholecystitis has been standardized , few data exist on the utility of postoperative antibiotic treatment . To determine the effect of postoperative amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid on infection rates after cholecystectomy . A total of 414 patients treated at 17 medical centers for grade I or II acute calculous cholecystitis and who received 2 g of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 3 times a day while in the hospital before and once at the time of surgery were randomized after surgery to an open-label , noninferiority , randomized clinical trial between May 2010 and August 2012 . After surgery , no antibiotics or continue with the preoperative antibiotic regimen 3 times daily for 5 days . The proportion of postoperative surgical site or distant infections recorded before or at the 4-week follow-up visit . An imputed intention-to-treat analysis of 414 patients showed that the postoperative infection rates were 17 % ( 35 of 207 ) in the nontreatment group and 15 % ( 31 of 207 ) in the antibiotic group ( absolute difference , 1.93 % ; 95 % CI , -8.98 % to 5.12 % ) . In the per-protocol analysis , which involved 338 patients , the corresponding rates were both 13 % ( absolute difference , 0.3 % ; 95 % CI , -5.0 % to 6.3 % ) . Based on a noninferiority margin of 11 % , the lack of postoperative antibiotic treatment was not associated with worse outcomes than antibiotic treatment . Bile cultures showed that 60.9 % were pathogen free . Both groups had similar Clavien complication severity outcomes : 195 patients ( 94.2 % ) in the nontreatment group had a score of 0 to I and 2 patients ( 0.97 % ) had a score of III to V , and 182 patients ( 87.8 % ) in the antibiotic group had a score of 0 to I and 4 patients ( 1.93 % ) had a score of III to V.

       " \" Women in academic medicine are not achieving the same career advancement as men , and face unique challenges in managing work and family alongside intense work demands . The purpose of this study was to investigate how a supportive department/division culture buffered women from the impact of work demands on work-to-family conflict . As part of a larger intervention trial , the authors collected baseline survey data from 133 women assistant professors at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in 2010 . Validated measures of work demands , work-to-family conflict , and a department/division culture were employed . Pearson correlations and general linear mixed modeling were used to analyze the data . Authors investigated whether work culture moderated the association between work demands and work-to-family conflict . Heavy work demands were associated with increased levels of work-to-family conflict . There were significant interactions between work demands , work-to-family conflict , and department/division culture . A culture conducive to women 's academic success significantly moderated the effect of work hours on time-based work-to-family conflict and significantly moderated the effect of work overload on strain-based work-to-family conflict . At equivalent levels of work demands , women in more supportive cultures experienced lower levels of work-to-family conflict . The culture of the department/division plays a crucial role in women 's work-to-family conflict and can exacerbate or alleviate the impact of extremely high work demands . This finding leads to important insights about strategies for more effectively supporting the careers of women assistant professors .\",\n",

Magnetic ressonance was performed to measure the gastric residual volume ( mL ) 120 and 180 minutes after the last ingestion . Gastric residual volume similar to basal condition was found after 2h and 3h of the intake of beverages . There was no difference in the mean SD GRV ( mL ) found at 120 minutes ( carbohydrate group : 22.916.6 and glutamine group : 19.710.7 ) and at 180 minutes ( carbohydrate group : 21.524.1 and glutamine group : 15.110.1 ) between the two drinks . Gastric emptying is efficient , and occurs in up to two hours after the intake of a beverage containing either carbohydrate alone or carbohydrate associated with glutamine . The addition of glutamine to carbohydrate-enriched drink seems to be safe for the use up to 2h before an operation .',\n",
       " ' Little is known about how different antiretrovirals effect inflammation and monocyte activation in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection .

From a random sample achieving an HIV type 1 RNA load of < 50 copies/mL by week 48 , changes over 24 and 48 weeks in levels of biomarkers of monocyte activation ( soluble CD14 [ sCD14 ] and soluble CD163 [ sCD163 ] ) , systemic inflammation ( soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I [ sTNF-RI ] , interleukin 6 [ IL-6 ] , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] ) , and vascular inflammation ( lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 [ Lp-PLA2 ] ) were compared . Multivariable linear regression was used . A total of 200 participants were included . Significant differences favoring EVG/c/FTC / TDF were noted for changes in sCD14 , hsCRP , and Lp-PLA2 levels . Factors independently associated with a larger decrease in the sCD14 level included random assignment to receive EVG/c/FTC / TDF , higher baseline sCD14 level , and larger decreases in hsCRP and sCD163 levels ; factors associated with a larger Lp-PLA2 decrease included higher baseline Lp-PLA2 and IL-6 levels , smaller increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides levels , a larger decrease in the sCD14 level , and a smaller decrease in the sCD163 level . EVG/c/FTC / TDF led to greater decreases in sCD14 , hsCRP , and Lp-PLA2 levels , compared with EFV/FTC/TDF . Randomization group independently predicted the change in sCD14 level , and changes in monocyte activation independently predicted the change in Lp-PLA2 level . There appears to be a more favorable effect of the integrase inhibitor EVG over efavirenz on immune activation , which may affect vascular inflammation .',\n",

After the concentration of propofol and remifentanil reached balance , tetanic stimulation , intubation , and incision were performed respectively with certain intervals . RE and SE were monitored during this procedure . Twelve patients were withdrawn from this study due to the use of vasoactive drugs . Finally , there were 28 cases in group A and 20 cases in group B. The RE and SE were not significantly changed before and after the tetanic stimulation in both groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . Both RE and SE were significantly increased after intubation in group B ( both P < 0.05 ) and after skin incision in both groups ( all P < 0.05 ) . Under the same stimulation , RE and SE showed no significant difference among groups administered with different levels of remifentanil ( P > 0.05 ) . Under the anesthesia with propofol + remifentanil , nociceptive response may cause the increase of RE and SE . Therefore , RE and SE may be useful parameters for monitoring the nociceptive response during general anaesthesia .',\n",

Patients were randomized to the MMC and non-MMC groups . Subconjunctival MMC ( 0.4 mg/ml for 3 min ) was used intraoperatively in 15 of 37 eyes . We defined total success as 25 % reduction in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) without medication . Follow-up time was 12 months . The mean preoperative IOP was significantly reduced from 15.2 2.8 mmHg to 9.3 2.7 ( p < 0.001 ) in the MMC group after 12-month follow-up and from 15.1 2.9 mmHg to 11.8 2.0 ( p < 0.001 ) in the non-MMC group . At 12 months , the mean IOP was significantly lower in the MMC group ( p = 0.003 ) compared with the non-MMC group . Total success was achieved in 10 of 15 eyes ( 67 % ) in MMC group and in nine of 22 eyes ( 41 % ) in non-MMC group ( p = 0.12 ) . The number of glaucoma medications was decreased from 2.2 0.8 to 0.5 1.2 in MMC group ( p = 0.001 ) and from 2.6 1.0 to 0.5 0.7 in non-MMC group ( p < 0.001 ) . Goniopuncture was performed in seven eyes ( 47 % ) in the MMC group , compared with 16 eyes ( 73 % ) in the non-MMC group ( p = 0.13 ) . IOP < 10 mmHg was achieved in seven of 15 eyes in the MMC group and in two of 22 in the non-MMC group ( p = 0.009 ) . Complication rate was low , and no difference between groups was evident . Deep sclerectomy seems to be effective and safe in reducing IOP in patients with NTG . Intraoperative use of MMC results in lower postoperative IOP 12-month postoperatively without increased rate of complications .',\n",
       " ' Vent-HeFT is a multicentre randomized trial designed to investigate the potential additive benefits of inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) on aerobic training ( AT ) in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) .

AT involved 45 min of ergometer training at 70-80 % of maximum heart rate , three times a week for both groups . In the AT/IMT group , IMT was performed at 60 % of sustained maximal inspiratory pressure ( SPImax ) while in the AT/SHAM group it was performed at 10 % of SPImax , using a computer biofeedback trainer for 30 min , three times a week . At baseline and at 3 months , patients were evaluated for exercise capacity , lung function , inspiratory muscle strength ( PImax ) and work capacity ( SPImax ) , quality of life ( QoL ) , LVEF and LV diameter , dyspnoea , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , and NT-proBNP . IMT resulted in a significantly higher benefit in SPImax ( P = 0.02 ) , QoL ( P = 0.002 ) , dyspnoea ( P = 0.004 ) , CRP ( P = 0.03 ) , and NT-proBNP ( P = 0.004 ) . In both AT/IMT and AT/SHAM groups PImax ( P < 0.001 , P = 0.02 ) , peak VO2 ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.04 ) , and LVEF ( P = 0.005 , P = 0.002 ) improved significantly ; however , without an additional benefit for either of the groups . This randomized multicentre study demonstrates that IMT combined with aerobic training provides additional benefits in functional and serum biomarkers in patients with moderate CHF . These findings advocate for application of IMT in cardiac rehabilitation programmes .',\n",

Using a randomized , controlled , observer-blinded design , 24 first-year residents were exposed to an oxygen pipeline contamination scenario , either where patient harm occurred ( independent group , n = 12 ) or where a simulated attending anaesthetist intervened to prevent harm ( supervised group , n = 12 ) . Residents were brought back 6 months later and exposed to a different scenario ( pipeline contamination ) with the same end point . Participants ' proper treatment , time to diagnosis , and non-technical skills ( measured using the Anaesthetists ' Non-Technical Skills Checklist , ANTS ) were measured . No participants provided proper treatment in the initial exposure . In the repeat encounter 6 months later , 67 % in the independent group vs 17 % in the supervised group resumed adequate oxygen delivery ( P = 0.013 ) . The independent group also had better ANTS scores [ median ( interquartile range ) : 42.3 ( 31.5-53 .1 ) vs 31.3 ( 21.6-41 ) , P = 0.015 ] . There was no difference in time to treatment if proper management was provided [ 602 ( 490-820 ) vs 610 ( 420-800 ) s , P = 0.79 ] . Allowing residents to practise independently in the simulation laboratory , and subsequently , allowing them to fail , can be an important part of simulation-based learning . This is not feasible in real clinical practice but appears to have improved resident performance in this study . The purposeful use of independent practice and its potentially negative outcomes thus sets simulation-based learning apart from traditional operating room learning .\",\n",
       " ' Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood and are related to CVD risk factors . This study evaluates tools and strategies to enhance adoption of new CVD risk reduction guidelines for children . Thirty-two practices , recruited and supported by 2 primary care research networks , were cluster randomized to a multifaceted controlled intervention . Practices were compared with guideline-based individual and composite measures for BMI , blood pressure ( BP ) , and tobacco . Composite measures were constructed by summing the numerators and denominators of individual measures . Preintervention and postintervention measures were assessed by medical record review of children ages 3 to 11 years . Changes in measures ( pre-post and intervention versus control ) were compared . The intervention group BP composite improved by 29.5 % , increasing from 49.7 % to 79.2 % , compared with the control group ( 49.5 % to 49.6 % ; P < .001 ) . Intervention group BP interpretation improved by 61.1 % ( from 0.2 % to 61.3 % ) , compared with the control group ( 0.4 % to 0.6 % ; P < .001 ) . The assessment of tobacco exposure or use for 5 - to 11-year-olds in the intervention group improved by 30.3 % ( from 3.4 % to 49.1 % ) versus the control group ( 0.6 % to 21.4 % ) ( P = .042 ) . No significant change was seen in the BMI or tobacco composites measures . The overall composite of 9 measures improved by 13.4 % ( from 48.2 % to 69.8 % ) for the intervention group versus the control group ( 47.4 % to 55.2 % ) ( P = .01 ) . Significant improvement was demonstrated in the overall composite measure , the composite measure of BP , and tobacco assessment and advice for children aged 5 to 11 years .',\n",
       " ' Veliparib ( ABT-888 ) is a potent oral inhibitor of Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase enzyme that is currently in development for the treatment of non-hematologic and hematologic malignancies . This analysis characterizes the population pharmacokinetics of veliparib , including developing a structural pharmacokinetic model and testing patient demographics and covariates for potential influence on veliparib pharmacokinetics in patients with non-hematologic malignancies . The analysis dataset included 3,542 veliparib concentration values from 325 patients with non-hematologic malignancies enrolled in three phase I and one phase II studies . Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using NONMEM . The likelihood ratio test was used for comparison of nested models , and visual predictive check was employed for model qualification . Covariates tested included body size measures , creatinine clearance ( CLCR ) , formulation , age , sex , race , liver function tests , and coadministration with temozolomide . A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described veliparib pharmacokinetics . The final model included fixed effects for CLCR on veliparib oral clearance ( CL/F ) and lean body mass ( LBM ) on volume of distribution ( V d/F ) . CL/F and V d/F were 20.9 L/h ( for a CLCR of 100 mL/min ) and 173 L ( for an LBM of 56 kg ) , respectively . Only LBM and CLCR were found to be determinants of veliparib V d/F and CL/F , respectively . Dosage adjustments of veliparib on the basis of body size , age , sex , race , liver function , and temozolomide coadministration are not necessary in patients with non-hematologic malignancies . This is the first study to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of veliparib , and the developed model will be used to conduct simulations and evaluate veliparib exposure-response relationships .',\n",

Opportunistic addition to an established randomised double blind placebo controlled trial . Christchurch , New Zealand , where a prolonged series of catastrophic earthquakes beginning on 4 September 2010 occurred , which caused widespread destruction , fatalities , and extensive psychological damage . 322 healthy adults ( 241 women ; 81 men ) aged 18-67 who were already participating in the vitamin D and acute respiratory infections study ( VIDARIS ) between February 2010 and November 2011 . Participants were randomised to receive an oral dose of either 200,000 IU vitamin D3 monthly for two months then 100,000 IU monthly ( n = 161 ) or placebo ( n = 161 ) for a total of 18 months . This is a post hoc analysis from the previously published VIDARIS trial . The primary endpoint in the current analysis was the self reported effects and overall adverse impact of the Christchurch earthquakes as assessed by questionnaire four months after the most destructive earthquake on 22 February 2011 , which was used as the index event . The secondary end point was the number of `` psychological '' adverse events that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments as part of the original VIDARIS trial . 308 participants completed the earthquake impact questionnaire ( n = 152 in the vitamin D group and 156 in the placebo group ) . There was no significant difference in the number of self reported adverse effects between those receiving vitamin D supplementation and those receiving placebo . There was also no difference in the overall adverse impact score between treatment groups ( ( 2 ) P = 0.44 ) . The exception was that those in the vitamin D group experienced more adverse effects on family relationships ( 22 % v 13 % ; ( 2 ) P = 0.03 ) . The number of psychological adverse events-such as fatigue , stress , anxiety , and insomnia-that participants reported at their usual monthly appointments was significantly higher after the earthquake ( ( 2 ) P = 0.007 ) but did not differ between treatment groups . In this trial , vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the adverse impact of earthquakes in healthy adults .

Ten eyes were randomized to either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab group in 1 eye only . Study eye received ranibizumab at baseline and at Months 1 and 2 . Injections at Months 3 , 4 , and 5 were at investigator 's discretion . Participants were followed monthly through 6 months with best-corrected visual acuity , fluorescein angiography , and optical coherence tomography . For study eyes at baseline , median best-corrected visual acuity letter score was 60 ( 20/64 Snellen equivalent ) and central subfield retinal thickness was 181.5 m. Median number of injections was six . Median change in best-corrected visual acuity at Month 3 was 4 letters ( range : -5 to 9 letters ) at both doses in the study eye and 3 letters ( range : -10 to 5 letters ) in the untreated fellow eye . At Month 3 , retinal leakage decreased 0.87 disk area and 0.76 disk area for 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg ranibizumab , respectively . Median change in central subfield retinal thickness was 1 m and -11 m for 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg ranibizumab , respectively . Ranibizumab ( 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ) decreases leakage secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 , but accompanying improvements in best-corrected visual acuity appear similar to improvements in the untreated fellow eye where retinal thickness is relatively unchanged .\",\n",

       " \" Chronic thoracic pain after cardiac surgery is prevalent ( 11 to 56 % ) and may affect patients ' physical and mental health status . Despite its favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties , high doses of remifentanil administered during surgery are reported to cause acute postoperative pain and increased requirements for analgesics . Recently , an association between remifentanil use and the incidence of chronic thoracic pain in the long term was also reported . Our objective is to investigate the influence of the intraoperative remifentanil on chronic postoperative pain in a prospective randomized controlled trial . In this prospective , randomized , single-blind clinical trial , all patients ( N = 126 ) between 18 and 85 years undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy receive a continuous infusion of propofol together with intermittent intravenous fentanyl at predetermined times perioperatively . Patients are randomized to receive either an additional continuous infusion of remifentanil ( 0.15 g ( -1 ) kgIBW ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ) or additional fentanyl ( 200 to 500 g ) as needed during surgery.The primary end point is the prevalence of chronic thoracic pain 12 months after surgery . Secondary end points include acute postoperative pain ; postoperative analgesic use ; chronic thoracic pain 3 and 6 months after surgery ; quality of life ( SF-12 ) at 3 , 6 and 12 months after surgery ; work productivity ; and use of health care . In addition , thermal detection and pain thresholds are measured preoperatively , 3 days after surgery and 12 months after surgery using quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) . Finally , the influence of several genetic variances on the different outcomes will be measured . Chronic thoracic pain is prevalent after cardiac surgery , and research is needed to minimize the risk of chronic persistent postoperative pain , which is an invalidating , long-term complication of surgery . The objective of this trial is to determine the influence of perioperative remifentanil on long-term pain outcomes for cardiac patients in a prospective randomized trial .

A nerve conduction test was performed on the contralateral normal side in 42 patients with unilateral vocal fold palsy . The recording was performed in the intact thyroarytenoid muscle using a monopolar needle . The electrical stimulation using a 37-mm monopolar needle was applied 3 cm below the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage , just lateral to the trachea and medial to the carotid artery , and its intensity was gradually increased until the amplitude of the electrical response reached the maximum level . The latency of the evoked muscle response was acquired at the first evoked waveform deflection from the baseline . The average latency of the recurrent laryngeal nerves was 1.980.26 ms. The latencies showed normal distribution according to the quantile-quantile plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( P = .098 ) . There was no significant difference in latencies between the right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves . Anthropometric factors including height and weight did not show any correlation with the latencies . We developed a reliable and safe laryngeal nerve conduction technique and obtained normal reference values for the recurrent laryngeal nerve conduction study . This laryngeal nerve conduction study can be an additional tool for detecting recurrent laryngeal nerve injury if it is performed in combination with the conventional laryngeal electromyography . 4 .',\n",

Half the participants received 0.25 mg oral haloperidol each day for 7 days , after which they received placebo daily for 4 weeks . The other half received placebo throughout the trial . One week after stopping the medication , the HAMD ratings of the drug-treated patients fell by 9.96 points , as compared to a reduction of 8.73 points in the placebo-treated patients , when comparing visits 1 and 4 . There was no such difference when comparing visits 2 and 4 . The differences were not significant , but indicated a trend . One week after the medication was stopped , the Clinical Global Index fell 1.640.18 units for the medication-treated patients , compared to 1.120.26 units for the placebo group ( P = 0.05 ) . The regimen was well tolerated . Seven days of an ultra-low dose of 0.25 mg haloperidol , followed by withdrawal of haloperidol , resulted in clinical depression improvement greater than placebo and significantly decreased psychomotor retardation , consistent with haloperidol-induced behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine .

The median age at surgery for patients with stereopsis was younger than for those without stereopsis ( 1.2 vs 2.4 months ; P = .002 ) . The median visual acuity for patients with stereopsis was better than for those without stereopsis ( 20/40 vs 20/252 ; P = .0003 ) . The type of optical correction did not influence stereopsis outcomes . However , 2 other factors did : age at surgery and visual acuity in the treated eye at age 4.5 years . Early surgery for unilateral congenital cataract and the presence of visual acuity better than or equal to 20/40 appear to be more important than the type of initial optical correction used for the development of stereopsis .',\n",

Sources of data were non-participation forms , oral clarification , patient records , telephone interviews with adolescents that declined to participate , and a questionnaire-based process evaluation among nurses . Non-participation appears to be a multi-factorial problem . Of those 290 adolescents eligible to participate , the majority ( n = 165 , 57 % ) declined to do so . Two-third of those ( n = 109 ) also refused usual care , which might be indicative of not wanting help and/or experiencing problems and the validity of the assessment instrument . The other one-third ( n = 56 ) did enrol in usual care and indicated other reasons for non-participation , such as a preference for face-to-face consultations , the extensive information that was provided , and not liking the idea of being randomized .

Additionally , although sleep medication use is highest among older adults , the quantitative electroencephalographic ( EEG ) profile of the most commonly prescribed sleep medication , zolpidem , in older adults is also unknown . We therefore quantified age-related and regional brain differences in sleep EEG with and without zolpidem . Thirteen healthy young adults aged 21.92.2 years and 12 healthy older adults aged 67.44.2 years participated in a randomized , double-blind , within-subject study that compared placebo to 5mg zolpidem . Older adults showed a smaller rise in SWA and zolpidem increased age-related differences in SWA rise time such that age differences were observed earlier after latency to persistent sleep . Age-related differences in EEG power differed by brain region . Older , but not young , adults showed zolpidem-dependent reductions in theta and alpha frequencies . Zolpidem decreased stage 1 in older adults and did not alter other age-related sleep architecture parameters . SWA findings provide additional support for reduced homeostatic sleep drive or reduced ability to respond to sleep drive with age . Consequences of reduced power in theta and alpha frequencies in older adults remain to be elucidated .',\n",

Both equations performed similarly in risk prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with decreased eGFR , except for patients with baseline eGFR of 45-59ml / min/1 .73 m2 , where the CKD-EPI equation predicted higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with those with no CKD . However , the magnitude of difference in risk prediction was too small to be clinically meaningful . Both equations showed similar predictive performance . However , we observed longer survival and no higher risk in those who were reclassified as having no CKD using the CKD-EPI equation , but these patients were classified earlier as having CKD using the MDRD equation . There was no clinically relevant difference in predictive performance for long-term survival by eGFR calculated using either of these equations in this elderly hypertensive population .',\n",
       " ' Ischemic mitral regurgitation is associated with increased mortality and morbidity . For surgical patients with moderate regurgitation , the benefits of adding mitral-valve repair to coronary-artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) are uncertain . We randomly assigned 301 patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation to CABG alone or CABG plus mitral-valve repair ( combined procedure ) . The primary end point was the left ventricular end-systolic volume index ( LVESVI ) , a measure of left ventricular remodeling , at 1 year . This end point was assessed with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in which deaths were categorized as the lowest LVESVI rank . At 1 year , the mean LVESVI among surviving patients was 46.122.4 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and 49.631.5 ml per square meter in the combined-procedure group ( mean change from baseline , -9.4 and -9.3 ml per square meter , respectively ) . The rate of death was 6.7 % in the combined-procedure group and 7.3 % in the CABG-alone group ( hazard ratio with mitral-valve repair , 0.90 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.38 to 2.12 ; P = 0.81 ) . The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at 1 year ( incorporating deaths ) showed no significant between-group difference ( z score , 0.50 ; P = 0.61 ) . The addition of mitral-valve repair was associated with a longer bypass time ( P < 0.001 ) , a longer hospital stay after surgery ( P = 0.002 ) , and more neurologic events ( P = 0.03 ) . Moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was less common in the combined-procedure group than in the CABG-alone group ( 11.2 % vs. 31.0 % , P < 0.001 ) . There were no significant between-group differences in major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events , deaths , readmissions , functional status , or quality of life at 1 year . In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation , the addition of mitral-valve repair to CABG did not result in a higher degree of left ventricular reverse remodeling . Mitral-valve repair was associated with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation but an increased number of untoward events . Thus , at 1 year , this trial did not show a clinically meaningful advantage of adding mitral-valve repair to CABG . Longer-term follow-up may determine whether the lower prevalence of mitral regurgitation translates into a net clinical benefit .

       " ' To investigate the effects of stellate ganglion block ( SGB ) on the peri-operative vasomotor cytokine content and intrapulmonary shunt in patients with esophagus cancer who underwent thoracotomy . Forty patients undergoing elective resection of esophageal cancer patients who had I ~ II American Society of Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) were randomly divided into total intravenous anesthesia group ( group N , n = 20 ) and total intravenous anesthesia combined with SGB group ( group S , n = 20 , 0.12 mL/kg 1 % lidocaine was used for SGB 10 min before induction ) . Heart rate ( HR ) , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , central venous pressure ( CVP ) , mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( MPAP ) and continuous cardiac output ( CCO ) were continuously monitored . The blood from internal jugular vein was drawn respectively before induction ( T0 ) , and 30 min ( T1 ) , 60 min ( T2 ) and 120 min ( T3 ) after one-lung ventilation ( OLV ) , and 30 min ( T4 ) after two-lung ventilation . The contents of plasma endothelin ( ET ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Meanwhile , arterial and mixed venous blood samples were collected for determination of blood gas and calculation of intrapulmonary shunt fraction ( Qs/Qt ) . During OLV , ET contents were increased significantly in two groups ( P < 0.05 ) , and no significant difference was presented ( P > 0.05 ) . NO content in group S was obviously higher than in group N at T3 ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas CGRP content in group N was markedly lower than in group S at each time point ( P < 0.05 ) . Qs/Qt was significantly increased in both groups after OLV , but there was no statistical significant regarding the Qs/Qt at each time point between two groups . Total intravenous anesthesia combined with SGB is conducive to regulation of perioperative vasomotor cytokines in thoracotomy , and has little effect on intrapulmonary shunt at the time of OLV .',\n",

       " ' Yes-associated protein ( YAP1 ) is frequently reported to function as an oncogene in many types of cancer , but in breast cancer results remain controversial . We set out to clarify the role of YAP1 in breast cancer by examining gene and protein expression in subgroups of patient material and by downregulating YAP1 in vitro and studying its role in response to the widely used anti-estrogen tamoxifen . YAP1 protein intensity was scored as absent , weak , intermediate or strong in two primary breast cancer cohorts ( n = 144 and n = 564 ) and mRNA expression of YAP1 was evaluated in a gene expression dataset ( n = 1107 ) . Recurrence-free survival was analysed using the log-rank test and Cox multivariate analysis was used to test for independence . WST-1 assay was employed to measure cell viability and a luciferase ERE ( estrogen responsive element ) construct was used to study the effect of tamoxifen , following downregulation of YAP1 using siRNAs . In the ER + ( Estrogen Receptor positive ) subgroup of the randomised cohort , YAP1 expression was inversely correlated to histological grade and proliferation ( p = 0.001 and p = 0.016 , respectively ) whereas in the ER - ( Estrogen Receptor negative ) subgroup YAP1 expression correlated positively to proliferation ( p = 0.005 ) . Notably , low YAP1 mRNA was independently associated with decreased recurrence-free survival in the gene expression dataset , specifically for the luminal A subgroup ( p < 0.001 ) which includes low proliferating tumours of lower grade , usually associated with a good prognosis . This subgroup specificity led us to hypothesize that YAP1 may be important for response to endocrine therapies , such as tamoxifen , extensively used for luminal A breast cancers . In a tamoxifen randomised patient material , absent YAP1 protein expression was associated with impaired tamoxifen response which was significant upon interaction analysis ( p = 0.042 ) . YAP1 downregulation resulted in increased progesterone receptor ( PgR ) expression and a delayed and weaker tamoxifen in support of the clinical data . Decreased YAP1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in the less aggressive luminal A breast cancer subgroup , likely due to the decreased tamoxifen sensitivity conferred by YAP1 downregulation .',\n",

       " ' Patients surviving stroke but who have significant impairment of function in the affected arm are at more risk of developing pain , stiffness and contractures . The abnormal muscle activity , associated with post-stroke spasticity , is thought to be causally associated with the development of these complications . Treatment of spasticity is currently delayed until a patient develops signs of these complications . This protocol is for a phase II study that aims to identify whether using OnabotulinumtoxinA ( BoNT-A ) in combination with physiotherapy early post stroke when initial abnormal muscle activity is neurophysiologically identified can prevent loss of range at joints and improve functional outcomes.The trial uses a screening phase to identify which people are appropriate to be included in a double blind randomised placebo-controlled trial . All patients admitted to Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust Hospitals with a diagnosis of stroke will be screened to identify functional activity in the arm . Those who have no function will be appropriate for further screening . Patients who are screened and have abnormal muscle activity identified on EMG will be given electrical stimulation to forearm extensors for 3 months and randomised to have either injections of BoNT-A or normal saline . The primary outcome measure is the action research arm test - a measure of arm function . Further measures include spasticity , stiffness , muscle strength and fatigue as well as measures of quality of life , participation and caregiver strain .

Seven patients underwent contrast-enhanced rest and stress cardiac perfusion measurements at 3T . Three slices were acquired in each patient and were divided into 16 segments , leading to 112 rest and stress data curves , which were analyzed using various tracer kinetic models as well as a model-free deconvolution . Plasma flow , plasma volume , and myocardial perfusion reserve were analyzed for the complete acquisition as well as for the first pass data only . Deconvolution analysis yielded stable results for both rest and stress analysis , while Fermi and one compartment models agree well for first pass data ( rest measurements only ) and prolonged data acquisition ( stress measurements only ) . More complex models do not yield satisfactory results for the short measurement times investigated in this study . When performing MRI-based quantification of myocardial perfusion , care must be taken that the method used is appropriate for the time frame under investigation . When a numerical deconvolution is used instead of tracer kinetic models , more stable results are obtained .',\n",

In this pilot study , body composition and fat distribution in offspring from obese women with and without GDM and lean women were assessed within the 1st year of life , and maternal and newborn plasma factors were related to offspring adipose tissue distribution . Serum and plasma samples from pregnant obese women with ( n = 16 ) or without ( n = 13 ) GDM and normoglycemic lean women ( n = 15 ) at 3rd trimester and offspring cord plasma were used for analyzing lipid profiles , insulin and adipokine levels . At week-1 and 6 , month-4 and year-1 , offspring anthropometrics and skinfold thickness ( SFT ) were measured and abdominal subcutaneous ( SCA ) and preperitoneal adipose tissue ( PPA ) were determined by ultrasonography . Cord insulin was significantly increased in the GDM group , whereas levels of cord leptin , total and high molecular weight ( HMW ) adiponectin were similar between the groups . Neonates of the GDM group showed significantly higher SFT and fat mass until week-6 and significantly increased SCA at week-1 compared to the lean group that persisted as strong trend at week-6 . Interestingly , PPA in neonates of the GDM group was significantly elevated at week-1 compared to both the lean and obese group . At month-4 and year-1 , significant differences in adipose tissue growth between the groups were not observed . Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that cord insulin levels are independently related to neonatal PPA that showed significant relation to PPA development at year-1 . Maternal fasted C-peptide and HMW adiponectin levels at 3rd trimester emerged to be determinants for PPA at week-1 . Maternal pregravid obesity combined with GDM leads to newborn hyperinsulinemia and increased offspring fat mass until week-6 , whereas pregravid obesity without GDM does not . This strongly suggests the pivotal role of GDM in the adverse offspring outcome . Maternal C-peptide and HMW adiponectin levels in pregnancy emerge to be predictive for elevated PPA in newborns and might be indicative for the obesity risk at later life . Altogether , the findings from our pilot study warrant evaluation in long-term studies . German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00004370 .',\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate these formulations in adults prior to use in paediatric studies . This open-label , 4-period , randomized , crossover study investigated the safety , tolerability and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir paediatric formulations and the effect of a high-fat meal on EC tablet pharmacokinetics in healthy adults . In a balanced , crossover design ( with a 4-day washout between treatments ) , 12 subjects received one 400 mg film-coated tablet ( fasted ) , four 100 mg EC tablets ( fasted ) , one 400 mg GFS dose ( fasted ) and four 100 mg EC tablets ( after a high-fat meal ) . AUC0 - and Cmax were 2.6-fold and 4.6-fold higher for GFS and 1.8-fold and 3.2-fold higher for EC versus film-coated tablets . The geometric mean C12h values for the GFS formulation ( 162 nM ) and the EC tablet ( 134 nM ) were similar to that of the film-coated tablet ( 149 nM ) . Administration with a high-fat meal increased C12h , decreased Cmax and delayed Tmax for the EC tablet , but did not affect AUC0 - . There were no serious adverse events ( AEs ) and no discontinuations due to drug-related clinical or laboratory AEs .

DCD was defined as MABC < 5th percentile in children with a Full-Scale IQ > 69 who did not have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy . There were 1433 children with known MABC corrected-age percentile as well as known Full-Scale IQ at 5 years and cerebral palsy status , of whom 735 had been randomly assigned to caffeine and 698 to placebo therapy . The rate of DCD was lower in those treated with caffeine ( 11.3 % ) than in the placebo group ( 15.2 % ) ( OR adjusted for center and baseline covariates , 0.71 , 95 % CI , 0.52-0 .97 ; P = .032 ) . Neonatal caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity reduces the rate of DCD at 5 years of age . As more children have DCD than have cerebral palsy , this is an important additional benefit from neonatal caffeine treatment .\",\n",
       " ' To determine whether exercise training might exert anti-inflammatory effect by reducing HMGB1 levels in women with breast cancer ( BC ) . We analyzed monocentric data from the DIANA ( DIET AND ANDROGENS ) -5 PROJECT . Study population consisted of 94 patients randomized into two groups : 61 patients ( 53 + / - 8 yrs , training group ) were assigned to a structured exercise training intervention ( 3 times/week for the first 3 months , and once / week for the following 9 months ) ; whereas 33 patients ( 52 + / - 7 yrs , control group ) followed only the general indications to adhere to the life-style intervention suggestions of the DIANA protocol . At study entry and after 12 months , all patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing , biochemical as - sessment [ HMGB1 , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) ] ; and lipid and glycemic profile . There were no significant differences between groups in baseline clinical and inflammatory profile . Among the training group , only 19/61 patients had high adherence to the exercise intervention . After stratifying the study population according to the level of adhesion to the exer - cise intervention , 1-year HMGB1 levels were lower among patients more adherent to exercise ( p for trend = 0.001 ) . Further adjusting for age , body mass index and baseline values , 1-year HMGB1 levels remained significantly and inversely associated to the level of adhesion to the exercise intervention ( B = -0.97 , SE = 0.43 , p = 0.01 ) . Moderate intensity exercise training in BC survivors is associated with reduced HMGB1 levels that are proportional to the level of adhesion to the exercise intervention , independently from other classical inflammatory molecules , suggesting an exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effect mediated by HMGB1 .',\n",
       " \" According to the literature , 40 % of injuries affecting school-age children are sports related . The role of physical education students , as future teachers , seems to be of high importance in terms of protecting children 's safety during sports classes . The aim is to evaluate the level of basic life support ( BLS ) knowledge and skills in physical education students instructed with the use of different methods . Second-year physical education students ( n = 104 , M age = 200.6 years ) were randomly assigned to three groups : experimental 1 ( E1 ) , experimental 2 ( E2 ) , and control ( C ) . Group E1 students participated in a 2-hour BLS course based on computer-assisted presentations . Group E2 trainees practiced BLS algorithm in pairs during a 2-hour course . No manikins were used in both intervention groups . Students of Group C were asked to learn BLS algorithm on their own . All groups fulfilled a 10-question multiple-choice test on BLS at the beginning and the end of the experiment . After completing the course participants performed BLS on a manikin . The results of knowledge test were not significant before an experiment but differed essentially among the groups afterward ( analysis of variance contrast analysis , p < .05 ) . Regardless of teaching method used , no significant differences were found among the students in preparatory BLS actions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) performance on a manikin . The level of CPR performance was very low in all groups . Students of both intervention groups improved their BLS knowledge after the training . Teaching methods used in the current study seemed to be ineffective in terms of practical CPR skills . Access to greater number of modern manikins should improve the BLS training in physical education students . Moreover , permanent consultation on instructional methods with emergency medicine experts is recommended for university teachers .\",\n",
       " ' This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of levosimendan , a positive inotropic drug with vasodilator effects , given intravenously to patients with acutely decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) . We performed 2 sequential trials , the first to develop a new measure of efficacy in 100 patients , and the second to use this measure to evaluate levosimendan in an additional 600 patients . Patients admitted with ADHF received placebo or intravenous levosimendan for 24 h in addition to standard treatment . The primary endpoint was a composite that evaluated changes in clinical status during the first 5 days after randomization . In the 600-patient trial , more levosimendan than placebo patients ( 58 vs. 44 ) were improved at all 3 pre-specified time points ( 6 h , 24 h , and 5 days ) , whereas fewer levosimendan patients ( 58 vs. 82 ) experienced clinical worsening ( p = 0.015 for the difference between the groups ) . These differences were apparent , despite more frequent intensification of adjunctive therapy in the placebo group ( 79 vs. 45 patients ) . Improvements in patient self-assessment and declines in B-type natriuretic peptide levels with levosimendan persisted for 5 days and were associated with reduced length of stay ( p = 0.009 ) . Similar findings were present in the 100-patient pilot trial . Levosimendan was associated with more frequent hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias during the infusion period and a numerically higher risk of death across the 2 trials ( 49 of 350 on a regimen of levosimendan vs. 40 of 350 on a regimen of placebo at 90 days , p = 0.29 ) . In patients with ADHF , intravenous levosimendan provided rapid and durable symptomatic relief . As dosed in this trial , levosimendan was associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events .

       " ' Multiple phase-2 trials in men with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer ( BRPC ) have assessed the impact of nonhormonal agents on PSA kinetics . We have previously demonstrated that changes in PSA kinetics correlate with metastasis-free survival ; however , it is unknown whether these changes also correlate with overall survival ( OS ) . We performed a combined retrospective analysis of 146 men with BRPC treated on phase-2 trials using one of four investigational drugs : lenalidomide ( n = 60 ) , marimastat ( n = 39 ) , ATN-224 ( n = 22 ) and imatinib ( n = 25 ) . We examined factors influencing OS , including within-subject changes in PSA kinetics ( PSA slope , PSA doubling time and PSA velocity ) , before and 6 months after treatment initiation . After a median follow-up of 83.1 months , 49 of 146 men had died . In univariate Cox regression analysis , two factors were associated with OS : baseline PSA velocity and change in PSA velocity on therapy . In a landmark multivariable model , stratified by study ( which controlled for age , Gleason score , type of local therapy and use of androgen-deprivation therapy prior to metastases ) , baseline PSA velocity and increase in PSA velocity on therapy remained independent predictors of OS . Median OS for men with an increase in PSA velocity on treatment was 115.4 months and was not reached for men with a decrease in PSA velocity ( hazard ratio = 0.47 , 95 % confidence interval 0.25-0 .88 ; P = 0.02 ) . This hypothesis-generating study suggests that within-subject changes in PSA velocity after initiation of nonhormonal therapy may correlate with OS in men with BRPC . If validated in prospective trials , change in PSA velocity may represent a reasonable intermediate end point for screening new agents in these patients .',\n",
       " ' The aims of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of and compliance with a new device for autoinflation in the treatment of persistent otitis media with effusion ( OME ) in young children . Forty-five children with persistent OME with a bilateral type B or C2 tympanogram for at least three months and history of subjective hearing loss , waiting for grommet surgery , were randomised to a treatment and a control group . Twenty-three children aged between three and eight years started as the treatment group with the new device for autoinflation . Another 22 children , aged between two and eight years were included as controls . After a period of four weeks , a cross-over was performed . Both groups underwent otomicroscopy , tympanometry and audiometry at inclusion and after one and two months for the evaluation of treatment efficiency . The primary outcome measurements were improvement in middle-ear pressure and hearing thresholds at eight weeks . Both groups were then followed up for another 10 months . In the treatment group , the mean middle-ear pressure for both ears and the mean hearing thresholds for the best ear improved by 166 daPa ( p < 0.0001 ) and 6 dB ( p < 0.0001 ) , respectively after four weeks , while in the control group , non-significant alterations were observed . After the cross-over of the control group to treatment , equivalent improvements in the mean middle-ear pressure and the mean hearing thresholds of 187 daPa ( p < 0.0001 ) and 7 dB ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively were achieved also in this group . After treatment in both groups at eight weeks , four of 45 children were submitted to grommet surgery . During the long-term follow-up another five children were submitted to surgery due to recurrence of disease . All the children managed to perform the manoeuvre and no side-effects were detected . The device demonstrated efficiency in improving both middle-ear pressure and hearing thresholds in most children after four weeks of treatment . It might therefore be possible to consider this method of autoinflation in children with persistent OME during the watchful waiting period .',\n",

The aim of this paper is to report the rationale and study protocol for the ` Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time ' ( ATLAS ) obesity prevention intervention for adolescent boys living in low-income communities . The ATLAS intervention will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 secondary schools in the state of New South Wales ( NSW ) , Australia ( 2012 to 2014 ) . ATLAS is an 8-month multi-component , school-based program informed by self-determination theory and social cognitive theory . The intervention consists of teacher professional development , enhanced school-sport sessions , researcher-led seminars , lunch-time physical activity mentoring sessions , pedometers for self-monitoring , provision of equipment to schools , parental newsletters , and a smartphone application and website . Assessments were conducted at baseline and will be completed again at 9 - and 18-months from baseline . Primary outcomes are body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference . Secondary outcomes include BMI z-scores , body fat ( bioelectrical impedance analysis ) , physical activity ( accelerometers ) , muscular fitness ( grip strength and push-ups ) , screen-time , sugar-sweetened beverage consumption , resistance training skill competency , daytime sleepiness , subjective well-being , physical self-perception , pathological video gaming , and aggression . Hypothesized mediators of behavior change will also be explored . ATLAS is an innovative school-based intervention designed to improve the health behaviors and related outcomes of adolescent males in low-income communities .\",\n",
       " ' Our recent work indicates that endogenous opioid activity influences analgesic responses to opioid medications . This secondary analysis evaluated whether endogenous opioid activity is associated with degree of opioid analgesic adverse effects , and whether chronic pain status and sex affect these adverse effects . Using a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , crossover design , 51 subjects with chronic low back pain and 38 healthy controls participated in 3 separate sessions , undergoing 2 laboratory-evoked pain tasks ( ischemic and thermal ) after receiving placebo , naloxone , or morphine . Endogenous opioid system function was indexed by the difference in pain responses between the placebo and naloxone conditions . These measures were examined for associations with morphine-related adverse effects . Chronic pain subjects reported significantly greater itching and unpleasant bodily sensations with morphine than controls ( P < 0.05 ) . Across groups , only 6 of 112 possible associations between adverse effects and blockade effects were significant . For the ischemic task , higher endogenous opioid function was associated with greater itching ( visual analog scale [ VAS ] ; P < 0.05 ) , numbness ( tolerance ; P < 0.001 ) , dry mouth ( tolerance ; P < 0.05 ) , and unpleasant bodily sensations ( VAS ; P < 0.05 ) . For the thermal task , higher endogenous opioid function was associated with greater numbness ( VAS ; P < 0.05 ) and feeling carefree ( VAS ; P < 0.05 ) . There were no significant main or interaction effects of chronic pain status or sex on these findings . No consistent relationships were observed between endogenous opioid function and morphine-related adverse effects . This is in stark contrast to our previous observation of strong relationships between elevated endogenous opioid function and smaller morphine analgesic effects .',\n",
       " ' A new core biopsy needle for endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) - guided sampling has recently been developed . The aim of this prospective multicenter study was to compare this needle with a standard needle in patients with solid pancreatic masses . Consecutive patients with solid pancreatic masses referred to 17 centers for EUS-guided sampling were included . Each patient had two passes with a standard 22G needle and a single pass with a 22G core needle performed in a randomized order . Samples from both needles were separately processed for liquid-based cytology and cell-block preparation and were assessed independently by two blinded expert pathologists . The primary endpoint was the accuracy of the detection of malignancy . The reference standard was based on further cytohistological analysis obtained under ultrasound or computed tomography scanning , endoscopic or surgical guidance , and/or by clinical follow-up with repeated imaging examinations for at least 12 months . The secondary endpoints were the rate of technical failure and the quality of the cytohistological samples obtained . Of the 80 patients included ( 49 men ; mean age 67.111.1 ) , 87.5 % had final malignant diagnoses ( adenocarcinoma n = 62 , 77.5 % ) . There was no difference between the needles in diagnostic accuracy ( standard needle 92.5 % vs. core needle 90 % ; P = 0.68 ) or technical failure . Both pathologists found the overall sample quality significantly better for the standard needle ( expert 1 , P = 0.009 ; expert 2 , P = 0.002 ) . The diagnostic accuracy of EUS sampling for solid pancreatic masses using standard and core needles seems comparable but with a better overall histological sample quality for the former .

A total of 286 children who were classified with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I and II , between three and 13 years old ( mean = 6.13 years old ) , and undergoing DRGA were enrolled in this study . The children were randomized to receive one of the three doses of palonosetron ( 0.0025 mg , 0.0050 mg , or 0.0075 mg ) or placebo immediately before induction of anesthesia . Compared with placebo , the incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the palonosetron groups ( P < .05 ) . However , there were no statistically significant differences among the palonosetron groups regarding the number of children with PONV during all time periods after anesthesia ( P < .05 ) . A single 0.0025 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron is recommended for further evaluation , as it appears to be an effective dose for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia .',\n",
       " ' To assess bacillus Calmette-Gurin maintenance treatment schedule for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer at 2 years , using one-third of the full dose and fewer instillations every 3 months or 6 months . This was a prospective , randomized , multicenter study . All patients had an intermediate - or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . They received three weekly instillations of one-third dose bacillus Calmette-Gurin every 6 months ( group I ) and two weekly instillations every 3 months ( group II ) during 3 years . In the two schedules we assessed efficacy , tolerance , leukocyturia and prostate-specific antigen . No significant difference was observed between the two groups for recurrence at 6 , 12 or 18 months . At 2 years , tumor recurrence was observed in 10.9 % and muscle invasion in 2.9 % of cases . Bacillus Calmette-Gurin tolerance was comparable - the adverse events score was 0.8 in group I and 1 in group II ( P = 0.242 ) . No statistical correlation was observed between the adverse events score over 2 years , either for leukocyturia ( P = 0.8891 ) or prostate-specific antigen level ( P = 0.7155 ) . Leukocyturia level was not significantly associated with tumor recurrence or progression . One-third dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Gurin is effective with no impact on tumor recurrence or muscle invasion . Furthermore , there seems to be no difference in tumor response or side-effects between patients receiving two or three maintenance instillations every 3 months or 6 months . In clinical practice , the use of leukocyturia or total prostate-specific antigen levels do not appear to be useful in predicting bacillus Calmette-Gurin toxicity .',\n",
       " ' To evaluate the usefulness of velocity ratio ( VR ) in patients with low gradient severe aortic stenosis ( LGSAS ) and preserved EF . LGSAS despite preserved EF represents a clinically challenging entity . Reliance on mean pressure gradient ( MPG ) may underestimate stenosis severity as has been reported in the context of paradoxical low flow , LGSAS . On the other hand , grading of stenosis severity by aortic valve area ( AVA ) may overrate stenosis severity due to erroneous underestimation of LV outflow tract ( LVOT ) diameter , small body size or inconsistencies in cut-off values for severe stenosis . We hypothesised that VR may have conceptual advantages over MPG and AVA , predict clinical outcomes and thereby be useful in the management of patients with LGSAS . Patients from the prospective Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis ( SEAS ) study with an AVA < 1.0 cm ( 2 ) , MPG40mmHg and EF55 % and asymptomatic at baseline were stratified according to VR with a cut-off value of 0.25 . Outcomes were evaluated according to aortic valve-related events and cardiovascular death . Of 435 patients with LGSAS , 197 ( 45 % ) had VR < 0.25 suggesting severe and 238 ( 55 % ) had VR0 .25 suggesting non-severe stenosis . Aortic valve-related events ( mean follow-up 4214months ) were more frequent in patients with VR < 0.25 ( 57 % vs 41 % ; p < 0.001 ) as was cardiovascular death within the first 24months ( p < 0.05 ) . In multivariable Cox regression analysis , MPG was the strongest independent predictor of aortic valve events ( p < 0.001 ) followed by VR ( p < 0.02 ) . Adjusting AVA by VR increased predictive accuracy for aortic valve events ( area under the receiver operating curve 0.62 ( 95 % CI 0.57 to 0.67 ) vs 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.51 to 0.61 ) for AVA , p = 0.02 ) with net reclassification improvement calculated at 0.36 ( 95 % CI 0.17 to 0.54 , p < 0.001 ) . VR did not improve the prediction of clinical events by MPG . In the difficult setting of LGSAS , VR shows a strong association with valve-related events and-although not outperforming MPG-may be particularly useful in guiding clinical management .

       " ' The objective was to assess the long-term safety profile of dual-release hydrocortisone ( DR-HC ) in patients with adrenal insufficiency ( AI ) . Randomised , open-label , crossover trial of DR-HC or thrice-daily hydrocortisone for 3 months each ( stage 1 ) followed by two consecutive , prospective , open-label studies of DR-HC for 6 months ( stage 2 ) and 18 months ( stage 3 ) at five university clinics in Sweden . Sixty-four adults with primary AI started stage 1 , and an additional 16 entered stage 3 . Patients received DR-HC 20-40mg once daily and hydrocortisone 20-40mg divided into three daily doses ( stage 1 only ) . Main outcome measures were adverse events ( AEs ) and intercurrent illness ( self-reported hydrocortisone use during illness ) . In stage 1 , patients had a median 1.5 ( range , 1-9 ) intercurrent illness events with DR-HC and 1.0 ( 1-8 ) with thrice-daily hydrocortisone . AEs during stage 1 were not related to the cortisol exposure-time profile . The percentage of patients with one or more AEs during stage 1 ( 73.4 % with DR-HC ; 65.6 % with thrice-daily hydrocortisone ) decreased during stage 2 , when all patients received DR-HC ( 51 % in the first 3 months ; 54 % in the second 3 months ) . In stages 1-3 combined , 19 patients experienced 27 serious AEs , equating to 18.6 serious AEs/100 patient-years of DR-HC exposure . This long-term prospective trial is the first to document the safety of DR-HC in patients with primary AI and demonstrates that such treatment is well tolerated during 24 consecutive months of therapy .',\n",
       " ' Low-fat and low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets can have a beneficial effect on longitudinal measures of blood pressure and blood lipids . We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in blood pressure and blood lipids in a population of premenopausal women . We hypothesized that results may differ by level of adherence to the respective diet protocol and baseline presence of hypertension or hyperlipidemia . Overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to a low-fat ( n = 41 ) or low-carbohydrate ( n = 38 ) diet . As part of the 52-week Lifestyle Eating and Fitness ( LEAF ) intervention trial , we fit linear mixed models to determine whether a change in outcome differed by treatment arm . Within-group trends in blood pressure and blood lipids did not differ ( p > 0.30 ) . Across study arms , there was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure ( SBP , 3mm Hg , p = 0.01 ) over time , but diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) did not change significantly over the course of the study . Blood lipids ( total cholesterol [ TC ] , low-density lipoproteins [ LDL ] , and high-density lipoproteins [ HDL ] ) all exhibited nonlinear trends over time ( p < 0.01 ) ; each decreased initially but returned to levels comparable to baseline by study conclusion ( p > 0.20 ) . We observed a decline in SBP among women who were hypertensive at baseline ( p < 0.01 ) , but hypercholesterolemia at baseline did not affect trends in blood lipids ( p > 0.40 ) . Our results support that dietary interventions may be efficacious for lowering blood pressure and blood lipids among overweight or obese premenopausal women . However , a decrease in SBP was the only favorable change that was sustained in this study population . These changes can be maintained over the course of a 1-year intervention , yet changes in blood lipids may be less sustainable .',\n",
       " ' Intrafraction tumour motion in helical tomotherapy was investigated by comparing pre - and mid-fraction CT scans in patients with early non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) to assess the efficacy of a 7-mm margin around gross tumour volumes ( GTVs ) in stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . Thirty patients with early-stage NSCLC received SBRT in four or five fractions for a total of 141 treatments . A slow positron emission tomography/CT scan was fused with the simulation CT to determine the GTV . A planning target volume was created by placing an isotropic margin of 7mm around the GTV . Data were retrospectively analyzed to assess translational tumour positional changes along the x , y and z axes and vector changes in millimeters from the pretreatment megavoltage ( MV ) - CT to the mid-fraction MV-CT . Average movements for all 141 treatment days along the x , y and z axes were 0.52.3 , -0.33.0 and 0.93.0 mm , respectively . Average movements for each patient along the x , y and z axes were 0.51.5 , -0.22.0 and 0.91.9 mm , respectively . Average vector displacement was 4.32.4 mm for all treatment days and 4.21.7 mm for each patient . Of 141 treatments , 137 ( 97.2 % ) fell within 7.0 mm in all axes . The addition of a 7-mm margin to the GTV for patients receiving SBRT for NSCLC using tomotherapy is adequate to account for tumour movement . Mid-fraction CT scans proved to be valuable in assessing intrafraction tumour motion .',\n",
       " ' Standard varenicline tartrate dosing was formulated to avoid adverse effects ( primarily nausea ) , but some patients may be underdosed . To our knowledge , no evidence-based guidance exists for physicians considering increasing varenicline dose if there is no response to the standard dosage . To determine whether increasing varenicline dose in patients showing no response to the standard dosage improves treatment efficacy . In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial , 503 smokers attending a stop smoking clinic commenced varenicline use 3 weeks before their target quit date ( TQD ) . Two hundred participants reporting no strong nausea , no clear reduction in smoking enjoyment , and less than 50 % reduction in their baseline smoking on day 12 received additional tablets of varenicline or placebo . All participants began standard varenicline tartrate dosing , gradually increasing to 2 mg/d . Dose increases of twice-daily varenicline ( 0.5 mg ) or placebo took place on days 12 , 15 , and 18 ( up to a maximum of 5 mg/d ) . Participants rated their smoking enjoyment during the prequit period and withdrawal symptoms weekly for the first 4 weeks after the TQD . Continuous validated abstinence rates were assessed at 1 , 4 , and 12 weeks after the TQD . The dose increase reduced smoking enjoyment during the prequit period , with mean ( SD ) ratings of 1.7 ( 0.8 ) for varenicline vs 2.1 ( 0.7 ) for placebo ( P = .001 ) . It had no effect on the mean ( SD ) frequency of urges to smoke at 1 week after the TQD , their strength , or the severity of withdrawal symptoms : these ratings for varenicline vs placebo were 2.7 ( 1.1 ) vs 2.6 ( 0.9 ) ( P = .90 ) , 2.6 ( 1.1 ) vs 2.8 ( 1.0 ) ( P = .36 ) , and 1.5 ( 0.4 ) vs 1.6 ( 0.5 ) ( P = .30 ) , respectively . The dose increase also had no effect on smoking cessation rates for varenicline vs placebo at 1 week ( 37 [ 37.0 % ] vs 48 [ 48.0 % ] , P = .14 ) , 4 weeks ( 51 [ 51.0 % ] vs 59 [ 59.0 % ] , P = .32 ) , and 12 weeks ( 26 [ 26.0 % ] vs 23 [ 23.0 % ] , P = .61 ) after the TQD . There was significantly more nausea ( P < .001 ) and vomiting ( P < .001 ) reported in the varenicline arm than in the placebo arm . Increasing varenicline dose in smokers with low response to the drug had no significant effect on tobacco withdrawal symptoms or smoking cessation . Physicians often consider increasing the medication dose if there is no response to the standard dosage . This approach may not work with varenicline . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT01206010 .',\n",

When placing drainage devices after total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of femoral neck fractures , the level of negative pressure should be chosen according to preoperative level of hemoglobin and HCT in patients . For old patients with femoral neck fracture , low negative pressure is more suitable .',\n",
       " \" One objective of this study was to assess the effects of laughter on the psychological , immunological and physiological systems of the body . Another objective was to introduce the Laughing Qigong Program ( LQP ) , as a method of standardization for simulated laughter interventions . A randomized , prospective , experimental study of the LQP was conducted in a group of adolescents ( n = 67 ) in Taiwan . During study-hall sessions , experimental subjects ( n = 34 ) attended the LQP for eight-weeks . Simultaneously , control subjects ( n = 33 ) read or did their homework . All subjects were tested before and after the intervention on the following : Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale ( RSE ) , Chinese Humor Scale ( CHS ) and Face Scale ( FS ) as psychological markers ; saliva cortisol ( CS ) as an immunological marker ; blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , and heart rate variability ( HRV ) as physiological markers of the body 's response to stress . Mood states ( FS ) were measured before/after each LQP session . Mood states ( p = .00 ) and humor ( p = .004 ; p = .003 ) improved in the experimental group ; no significant changes were found in the controls ( p = 69 ; p = 60 ) . The immunological marker of stress , cortisol levels , decreased significantly for those who participated in the LQP ( p = .001 ) , suggesting lower levels of stress after completion of the program . The LQP is a non-pharmacological and cost-effective means to help adolescents mitigate stresses in their everyday life .\",\n",
       " ' Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B ( MnB ) is a major cause of invasive meningococcal disease in infants . A conserved , surface-exposed lipoprotein , LP2086 ( a factor H-binding protein [ fHBP ] ) , is a promising MnB vaccine target . A bivalent , recombinant vaccine targeting the fHBP ( rLP2086 ) of MnB was developed . This phase 1/2 clinical study was designed to assess the immunogenicity , safety , and tolerability of a 4-dose series of the rLP2086 vaccine at 20 - , 60 - , 120 - , or 200-g dose levels in vaccine-naive infants when given with routine childhood vaccines . The study was to consist of two phases : a single-blind sentinel phase and an open-label full enrollment phase . During the sentinel phase , randomization of subjects to the next higher dose was delayed pending a 14-day safety review of dose 1 of the preceding dose cohort . The full enrollment phase was to occur after completion of the sentinel phase . Local reactions were generally mild and adverse events infrequent ; however , after only 46 infants were randomized into the study , fever rates were 64 % and 90 % in subjects receiving one 20 - or 60-g rLP2086 dose , respectively . Most fevers were < 39.0 C. Only 2 subjects in the 20-g group and 1 subject in the 60-g group experienced fevers > 39.0 C ; no fevers were > 40.0 C. Due to these high fever rates , the study was terminated early . No immunogenicity data were collected . This report discusses the safety and acceptability of rLP2086 in infants after one 20 - or 60-g dose . Due to the high fever rate experienced in the 20 - and 60-g groups , rLP2086 in the current formulation may not be acceptable for infants .',\n",

       " ' We evaluated the effects of cognitive speed of processing training ( SOPT ) on the development of additional Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) difficulties and the reduction of depressive symptoms in the Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study ( IHAMS ) . Six hundred eighty-one patients were randomized to 4 groups : 10 hr of on-site SOPT , 10 hr of on-site SOPT plus 4 hr of boosters , 10 hr of at-home SOPT , or 10 hr of on-site attention-control ( crossword puzzles ) . Developing additional difficulties with IADLs and reductions in depressive symptoms 1 year later were evaluated using multiple logistic regression . The on-site SOPT with boosters group had reduced odds of developing additional difficulties with IADLs ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] = 0.45 , p = .044 ) compared with attention-controls . The on-site SOPT with boosters group also had increased odds of reduced depressive symptom levels ( AOR = 2.93 , p = .003 ) compared with attention-controls . These findings provide evidence that SOPT transfers beyond the cognitive skills trained to meaningful downstream improvements in the lives of middle-aged and older adults .',\n",
       " ' The success of damage-control surgery ( DCS ) for the treatment of trauma has led to its use in other surgical problems such as abdominal sepsis . Previous studies using direct peritoneal resuscitation ( DPR ) for the treatment of trauma have yielded promising results . We present the results of the application of this technique to patients experiencing abdominal sepsis . We enrolled 88 DCS patients during a 5 year-period ( January 2008 to December 2012 ) into a propensity-matched study to evaluate the utility of using DPR in addition to standard resuscitation . DPR consisted of peritoneal lavage with 2.5 % DELFLEX , and abdominal closure was standardized across both groups . Patients were matched using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) variables . Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed . There were no differences between the control and experimental groups with regard to age , sex , ethnicity , or APACHE II at 24 hours . Indications for damage control included pancreatitis , perforated hollow viscous , bowel obstruction , and ischemic enterocolitis . Patients undergoing DPR had both a higher rate of ( 68 % vs. 43 % , p < 0.03 ) and a shorter time to definitive fascial closure ( 5.9 [ 3.2 ] days vs. 7.7 [ 4.1 ] days , p < 0.02 ) . DPR patients had a decreased APACHE II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score compared with the controls at 48 hours . In addition , DPR patients had fewer abdominal complications compared with the controls ( RR , 0.57 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.32-1 .01 ; p = 0.038 ) . Ventilator days and intensive care unit length of stay were both significantly reduced in the DPR group . The DPR group showed a lower overall mortality at 30 days ( 16 % vs. 27 % , p = 0.15 ) . DPR reduces time to definitive abdominal closure , increases primary fascial closure , and reduces intra-abdominal complications following DCS . DPR may also attenuate progressive physiologic injury as demonstrated by a reduction in 48-hour intensive care unit severity scores . As a result , DPR following DCS may afford better outcomes to patients experiencing shock . Therapeutic study , level III .',\n",
       " ' The importance of vitamin D on bone health and osteoporosis was studied by many researchers . The main role of the Vitamin D is to absorb calcium and phosphate and increase bone mineralization . Older people are at an increased risk of the inadequate vitamin D production in the skin because of lower sun exposure and reduced ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of short-term ( 2 weeks ) low energy UVB irradiation in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using bone mineral density and bone turnover markers . A three-month , single-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the University hospital in Daegu , Republic of Korea . Fifty-two postmenopausal Korean women ( older than 65 years ) with osteoporosis were randomly allocated to have either low energy UVB or placebo for 30 minutes a day for two weeks of treatment during winter . Laboratory analysis and physical examination before and 4 , 8 and 12 weeks after treatment were carried out and BMD was measured before and 8 and 12 weeks after treatment . The effects of time and treatment interaction between these two groups were evaluated by repeated-measure two-factor analysis , and subgroup analysis was performed to examine UVB effect on the vitamin D insufficient group [ serum 25 ( OH ) D3 concentration < 30 ng/mL ] . In vitamin D insufficient group , the effect of UVB irradiation on vitamin D and bone ALP as well as additional benefit on bone formation was confirmed . The vitamin D insufficient group showed statistically significant increment in serum 25 ( OH ) D3 compared with the normal group ( p < 0.05 ) . However , there was no significant difference between two groups in the other bone turnover markers , such as serum calcium , PTH-C , serum osteocalcin , serum CTX and BMD . Low-energy-short-term UVB radiation for postmenopausal women may be of use in vitamin D synthesis . There was a modest benefit in change of bone ALP especially in women with the insufficient vitamin D.',\n",

Fifty-nine patients with mCRC and disease control after standard first-line chemotherapy were randomised to MGN1703 60mg ( N = 43 ) or placebo ( N = 16 ) . The hazard ratio ( HR ) for the primary endpoint [ progression-free survival ( PFS ) from the start of maintenance ] was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.29-1 .08 ; P = 0.07 ) and 0.55 ( 95 % CI 0.3-1 .0 ; P = 0.04 ) by independent and investigator review , respectively . MGN1703 significantly improved PFS measured from the start of induction therapy versus placebo on independent ( HR 0.49 ; 95 % CI 0.26-0 .94 ; P = 0.03 ) and investigator review ( HR 0.50 ; 95 % CI 0.31-1 .02 ; P = 0.02 ) . Overall survival ( OS ) data remain immature ( HR 95 % ; 95 % CI 0.3-1 .5 ; P = 0.29 ) with 28/43 patients alive after a medium follow-up of > 17months . Retrospective subgroup analysis showed a significant effect of MGN1703 on PFS versus placebo in patients with greater than median tumour size reduction and normalised carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations following induction therapy , and in patients with elevated activated NKT cells3 .08 % . Adverse events were mild to moderate and limited to injection-site reactions or linked to general immune system activation . MGN1703 maintenance treatment was well tolerated and appears to induce durable and prolonged PFS and disease control in a subgroup of patients with mCRC following induction therapy . Activated NKT cells may be a predictive biomarker for selecting patients likely to benefit more from MGN1703 .',\n",
       " ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases , affecting approximately 1 % of the UK adult population . Patients suffer considerable pain , stiffness and swelling and can sustain various degrees of joint destruction , deformity , and significant functional decline . In addition , the economic burden due to hospitalisation and loss of employment is considerable , with over 50 % of patients being work-disabled within 10years of diagnosis . Despite several biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( bDMARD ) now available , there is a lack of data to guide biologic sequencing . In the UK , second-line biologic treatment is restricted to a single option , rituximab . The aim of the SWITCH trial is to establish whether an alternative-mechanism-TNF-inhibitor ( TNFi ) or abatacept are as effective as rituximab in patients with RA who have failed an initial TNFi drug . SWITCH is a pragmatic , phase IV , multi-centre , parallel-group design , open-label , randomised , controlled trial ( RCT ) comparing alternative-mechanism-TNFi and abatacept with rituximab in patients with RA who have failed an initial TNFi drug . Participants are randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive alternative mechanism TNFi , ( monoclonal antibodies : infliximab , adalimumab , certolizumab or golimumab or the receptor fusion protein , etanercept ) , abatacept or rituximab during the interventional phase ( from randomisation up to week 48 ) . Participants are subsequently followed up to a maximum of 96weeks , which constitutes the observational phase . The primary objective is to establish whether an alternative-mechanism-TNFi or abatacept are non-inferior to rituximab in terms of disease response at 24weeks post randomisation . The secondary objectives include the comparison of alternative-mechanism-TNFi and abatacept to rituximab in terms of disease response , quality of life , toxicity , safety and structural and bone density outcomes over a 12-month period ( 48weeks ) and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching patients to alternative active therapies compared to current practice . SWITCH is a well-designed trial in this therapeutic area that aims to develop a rational treatment algorithm to potentially inform personalised treatment regimens ( as opposed to switching all patients to only one available ( and possibly unsuccessful ) therapy ) , which may lead to long-term improved patient outcomes and gains in population health .

In 2306 kidney transplant recipients , 250 anemic patients ( 11 % ) with stable graft function were followed at the Hamed Al-Essa Organ Transplant Centre ( Kuwait ) and were assessed for anemia . We enrolled 120 patients into this open-label study in 2 groups : group 1 had treatment with darbepoetin alfa ( 86 patients ) and group 2 had continuous erythropoietin receptor activator ( 34 patients ) . Patient age correlated negatively with serum iron level . Serum ferritin correlated negatively with hemoglobin level 6 months after transplant but not at time of transplant . Most patients were women who received their grafts from male donors . The 2 groups were comparable in frequency of rejection and mean hemoglobin and serum albumin levels at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months after transplant . There was no difference between the 2 groups in renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ) ; posttransplant complications such as new-onset diabetes after transplant , hypertension , serious bacterial infections , or patient and graft outcomes . Anemia is an important problem after kidney transplant , and iron use is suboptimal in kidney transplant recipients .

Participants were allocated to a Balance Group , using the ` Wii Fit Plus ' in standing , or Upper Limb Group , using the ` Wii Sports/Sports Resort ' in sitting . Both groups undertook three 45 minute sessions per week over two to four weeks in addition to standard care . The primary focus was feasibility , addressed by recruitment , retention , adherence , acceptability and safety . Efficacy was evaluated by balance , mobility and upper limb outcomes . Twenty-one percent of individuals screened were recruited and 86 % ( n = 30 ) of eligible people agreed to participate . Study retention and session adherence was 90 % and > 99 % , respectively , at two weeks ; dropping to 70 % and 87 % at four weeks due to early discharge . All participants reported enjoying the sessions and most felt they were beneficial . No major adverse events occurred . Wii use by the Balance Group was associated with trends for improved balance , with significantly greater improvement in outcomes including the Step Test and Wii Balance Board-derived centre of pressure scores .

A total of 188 poor prognosis patients recruited in a randomized clinical trial received four courses intravenous carboplatin day 1 and oral vinorelbine day 1 and 8 , at 3-week intervals . The experimental arm ( N = 94 ) received radiotherapy with fractionation 42 Gy/15 , starting at the second chemotherapy course . This subset study compares outcomes in patients with tumors larger than 7 cm ( N = 108 ) versus tumors 7 cm or smaller ( N = 76 ) . Among those with tumors larger than 7 cm , the median overall survival in the chemotherapy versus CRT arm was 9.7 and 13.4 months , respectively ( p = 0.001 ) . The 1-year survival was 33 % and 56 % , respectively ( p = 0.01 ) . Except for a temporary decline during treatment , HRQOL was maintained in the CRT arm , regardless of tumor size . Among those who did not receive CRT , patients with tumors larger than 7 cm experienced a gradual decline in the HRQOL . The CRT group had significantly more esophagitis and hospitalizations because of side effects regardless of tumor size . In patients with poor prognosis and inoperable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer , large tumor size should not be considered a negative predictive factor . Except for performance status 2 , patients with tumors larger than 7 cm apparently benefit from CRT .',\n",

ACCENT I was a multicentre , randomised , placebo-controlled study . Week 14 trough levels and CRP percentage decrease from baseline to week 14 were compared between patients with and without durable sustained response through week 54 . Sensitivity and specificity were determined to predict durable sustained response . Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves identified optimal cut-off points ; logistic regression determined ORs . After induction with 5mg/kg infliximab , 25 % ( 37/147 ) and 33 % ( 47/144 ) of patients sustained week 14 response to infliximab 5 or 10mg/kg , respectively , administered every 8weeks without dose escalation , through week 54 . Median week 14 trough levels of patients with and without durable sustained response to infliximab 5mg/kg were 4.0 and 1.9 g/mL , respectively ( p = 0.0331 ) . Optimal predictors of durable sustained response to maintenance infliximab 5mg/kg were week 14 trough level 3.5 g/mL and 60 % CRP decrease ( ORs ( 95 % CI ) , 3.5 ( 1.1 to 11.4 ) and 7.3 ( 1.4 to 36.7 ) ) , respectively , in patients with raised baseline CRP ( > 8.0 mg/L ) ; area under the ROC curve was 0.75 for both predictors . A 3.5 g/mL week 14 infliximab serum level did not predict durable sustained response to 10mg/kg maintenance infliximab . Patients with durable sustained response to maintenance infliximab 5mg/kg had higher postinduction trough levels than patients without durable sustained response .

While it is recognized that they share common social drivers , there is limited evidence surrounding the potential of community interventions to reduce violence and HIV risk at the community level . The SASA ! study assessed the community-level impact of SASA ! , a community mobilization intervention to prevent violence and reduce HIV-risk behaviors . From 2007 to 2012 a pair-matched cluster randomized controlled trial ( CRT ) was conducted in eight communities ( four intervention and four control ) in Kampala , Uganda . Cross-sectional surveys of a random sample of community members , 18 - to 49-years old , were undertaken at baseline ( n = 1,583 ) and four years post intervention implementation ( n = 2,532 ) . Six violence and HIV-related primary outcomes were defined a priori . An adjusted cluster-level intention-to-treat analysis compared outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow-up . The intervention was associated with significantly lower social acceptance of IPV among women ( adjusted risk ratio 0.54 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.38 to 0.79 ) and lower acceptance among men ( 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.01 to 1.15 ) ; significantly greater acceptance that a woman can refuse sex among women ( 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.07 to 1.52 ) and men ( 1.31 , 95 % CI 1.00 to 1.70 ) ; 52 % lower past year experience of physical IPV among women ( 0.48 , 95 % CI 0.16 to 1.39 ) ; and lower levels of past year experience of sexual IPV ( 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.33 to 1.72 ) . Women experiencing violence in intervention communities were more likely to receive supportive community responses . Reported past year sexual concurrency by men was significantly lower in intervention compared to control communities ( 0.57 , 95 % CI 0.36 to 0.91 ) . This is the first CRT in sub-Saharan Africa to assess the community impact of a mobilization program on the social acceptability of IPV , the past year prevalence of IPV and levels of sexual concurrency .

Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before the procedure and was resumed within 24 hours after the procedure . Follow-up of patients continued for 30 days after the procedure . The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism ( stroke , systemic embolism , or transient ischemic attack ) and major bleeding . In total , 1884 patients were enrolled , with 950 assigned to receive no bridging therapy and 934 assigned to receive bridging therapy . The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 0.4 % in the no-bridging group and 0.3 % in the bridging group ( risk difference , 0.1 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -0.6 to 0.8 ; P = 0.01 for noninferiority ) . The incidence of major bleeding was 1.3 % in the no-bridging group and 3.2 % in the bridging group ( relative risk , 0.41 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 to 0.78 ; P = 0.005 for superiority ) . In patients with atrial fibrillation who had warfarin treatment interrupted for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure , forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding .

We describe the distribution of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors , overall and by geographical region , at study baseline . The distribution of CVD risk factors was assessed and compared by geographical region among START participants who had a baseline electrocardiogram ( n = 4019 ; North America , 11 % ; Europe/Australia/Israel , 36 % ; South America , 26 % ; Asia , 4 % ; Africa , 23 % ; median age 36 years ; 26 % female ) . About 58.3 % ( n = 2344 ) of the participants had at least one CVD risk factor and 18.9 % ( n = 761 ) had two or more . The most common CVD risk factors were current smoking ( 32 % ) , hypertension ( 19.3 % ) and obesity ( 16.5 % ) . There were significant differences in the prevalence of CVD risk factors among geographical regions . The prevalence of at least one risk factor across regions was as follows : North America , 70.0 % ; Europe/Australia/Israel , 65.1 % ; South America , 49.4 % ; Asia , 37.0 % ; Africa , 55.8 % ( P-value < 0.001 ) . Significant regional differences were also observed when risk factors were used as part of the Framingham and Data Collection on Adverse events of Anti-HIV Drugs ( D : A :D ) risk scores or used to define a favourable risk profile . CVD risk factors are common among START participants , and their distribution varies by geographical region . Better understanding of how and why CVD risk factors develop in people with HIV infection and their geographical distributions could shed light on appropriate strategies for CVD prevention and may inform the interpretation of the results of START , as CVD is expected to be a major fraction of the primary endpoints observed .',\n",
       " \" This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate whether the serum procalcitonin ( PCT ) level can be utilized to guide the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma . A total of 293 consecutive patients with suspected asthma attacks from February 2005 to July 2010 participated in this study . 225 patients completed the study . Serum PCT levels , and other inflammatory biomarkers of all patients were measured . In addition to the standard treatment , the control group received antibiotics according to the attending physicians ' discretions , while the patients in the PCT group were treated with antibiotics according to serum PCT concentrations . Antibiotics usage was strongly discouraged when the PCT concentration was below 0.1 g/L ; discouraged when the PCT concentration was between 0.1 g/L and 0.25 g/L ; or encouraged when the PCT concentration was above 0.25 g/L . The primary endpoint was the determination of antibiotics usage . The second endpoints included the diagnostic accuracy of PCT and other laboratory biomarkers the effectiveness of asthma control , secondary ED visits , hospital re-admissions , repeated needs for steroids or dosage increase , needs for antibiotics , WBC count , PCT levels and FEV1 % . At baseline , two groups were identical regarding clinical , laboratory and symptom score . Probability of the antibiotics usage in the PCT group ( 46.1 % ) was lower than that in the control group ( 74.8 % ) ( 2 = 21.97 , p < 0.001 . RR = 0.561 , 95 % CI 0.441-0 .713 ) . PCT and IL-6 showed good diagnostic significance for bacterial asthma ( r = 0.705 , p = 0.003 ) . The degrees of asthma control in patients were categorized to three levels and were comparable between the two groups at the six weeks follow-up period ( 2 = 1.62 , p = 0.45 ) . There were no significant difference regarding other secondary outcomes ( p > 0.05 ) . The serum PCT concentration can be used to effectively determine whether the acute asthma patients have bacterial infections in the respiratory tract , and to guide the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations , which may substantially reduce unnecessary antibiotic use without compromising the therapeutic outcomes .

       " ' The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 randomized , blinded , sham-controlled trial confirmed the safety of renal denervation ( RDN ) , but did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint . Prior RDN studies have demonstrated significant and durable reductions in blood pressure . This analysis investigated factors that may help explain these disparate results . Patients with resistant hypertension were randomized 2 : 1 to RDN ( n = 364 ) or sham ( n = 171 ) . The primary endpoint was the difference in office systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) change at 6 months . A multivariable analysis identified predictors of SBP change . Additional analyses examined the influence of medication changes , results in selected subgroups and procedural factors . Between randomization and the 6-month endpoint , 39 % of patients underwent medication changes . Predictors of office SBP reduction at 6 months were baseline office SBP 180 mmHg , aldosterone antagonist use , and non-use of vasodilators ; number of ablations was a predictor in the RDN group . Non-African-American patients receiving RDN had a significantly greater change in office SBP than those receiving sham ; -15.2 23.5 vs. -8.6 24.8 mmHg , respectively ( P = 0.012 ) . Greater reductions in office and ambulatory SBP , and heart rate were observed with a higher number of ablations and energy delivery in a four-quadrant pattern . Post hoc analyses , although derived from limited patient cohorts , reveal several potential confounding factors that may partially explain the unexpected blood pressure responses in both the sham control and RDN groups . These hypothesis-generating data further inform the design of subsequent research to evaluate the potential role of RDN in the treatment of resistant hypertension .

A commonly held view is that SVI is only a minor ailment , yet randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) show that treatment improves quality of life ( QoL ) and is cost-effective . In an effort to curb the treatment costs of this common disorder , rationing is applied in many health care systems , often limiting the reimbursement of treatment to those with soft tissue changes . This cohort study draws its data from an interventional RCT . After informed consent , consecutive patients with symptomatic unilateral SVI were randomized to receive surgical ligation and stripping or endovenous laser ablation . This analysis differentially studies the outcomes of patients with simple varicose veins ( C2 : n = 191 ) and soft tissue complications ( C3-4 : n = 76 ) . Effectiveness outcomes measured up to 1 year included the following : Qol [ short form 36 ( SF36 ) , EuroQol , and the Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire ] , clinical recurrence , and the need for secondary procedures . Multivariable regression analysis was used to control for potential confounding factors . Both groups saw significant improvements in QoL . All improvements were equal between groups apart from the SF36 domain of Bodily Pain , where C2 saw an improvement of 12.8 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 4.8-20 .8 ] points over C3-4 participants ( P = 0.002 ) , who also suffered more recurrence [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.7 , 95 % CI : 1.2-6 .1 , P = 0.022 ] and required more secondary procedures ( OR = 4.4 , 95 % CI : 1.2-16 .3 , P = 0.028 ) .

There is growing support for colorectal cancer survivors who are experiencing problems after cancer treatment to engage in self-management programs to reduce symptom distress . However , there is inconclusive evidence as to the effectiveness of such program especially in Asian region . This study tested the effects of a six-month nurse-led self-efficacy-enhancing intervention for patients with colorectal cancer , compared with routine care over a six-month follow up . A randomized controlled trial with repeated measures , two-group design . Three teaching hospitals in Guangzhou , China . One hundred and fifty-two Chinese adult patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer were recruited . The intervention group ( n = 76 ) received self-efficacy-enhancing intervention and the control group ( n = 76 ) received standard care . The participants were randomized into either intervention or control group after baseline measures . The outcomes of the study ( self-efficacy , symptom distress , anxiety , depression and quality of life ) were compared at baseline , three and six months after the intervention . Sixty-eight participants in the intervention group and 53 in the control group completed the study . Their mean age was 53 ( SD = 11.3 ) . Repeated measure MANOVA found that the patients in the intervention group had significant improvement in their self-efficacy ( F = 7.26 , p = 0.003 ) and a reduction of symptom severity ( F = 5.30 , p = 0.01 ) , symptom interference ( F = 4.06 , p = 0.025 ) , anxiety ( F = 6.04 , p = 0.006 ) and depression ( F = 6.96 , p = 0.003 ) at three and six months , compared with the control group .

       " ' Studies that have examined the impact of a physical activity intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors have yielded conflicting results . The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a standardized physical activity program on adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors in schoolchildren . Cluster randomized trial study of 712 schoolchildren , 8-10 years , from 20 public schools in the Province of Cuenca , Spain . The intervention ( MOVI-2 ) consisted of play-based and non-competitive activities . MOVI-2 was conducted during two 90-minute sessions on weekdays and one 150-minute session on Saturday mornings every week between September 2010 and May 2011 . We measured changes in adiposity ( overweight/obesity prevalence , body mass index [ BMI ] , triceps skinfold thickness [ TST ] , body fat % , fat-free mass , waist circumference ) and other cardiometabolic risk factors ( LDL-cholesterol , triglycerides/HDL-cholesterol ratio , insulin , C-reactive protein and blood pressure ) . The analyses used mixed regression models to adjust for baseline covariates under cluster randomization . Among girls , we found a reduction of adiposity in intervention versus control schools , with a decrease in TST ( -1.1 mm ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -2.3 to -0.7 ) , body fat % ( -0.9 % ; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.4 ) , waist circumference ( -2.7 cm ; 95 % CI -4.5 to -0.9 ) , and an increase in fat-free mass ( 0.3 kg ; 95 % CI 0.01 to 0.6 ) . The intervention also led to lower serum LDL-cholesterol and insulin levels . Among boys , a reduction in waist circumference ( -1.4 cm ; 95 % CI -2.6 to -0.1 ; P = 0.03 ) , and an increase in fat-free mass ( 0.5 kg ; 95 % CI 0.2 to 0.9 ; P = 0.003 ) was associated with the intervention versus control schools . The prevalence of overweight/obesity or underweight , BMI , and other cardiometabolic risk factors was not modified by the intervention . No important adverse events were registered .

Seven hundred and fifty mRCC patients were randomized to oral sunitinib 50 mg/day in repeated cycles of a 4-week on/2-week off schedule or IFN - 9 million units subcutaneously thrice weekly . Plasma samples collected from a subset of 63 patients on days 1 and 28 of cycles 1-4 and at end of treatment were analyzed by ELISA . Baseline characteristics of biomarker-evaluated patients in sunitinib ( N = 33 ) and IFN - ( N = 30 ) arms were comparable to their respective intent-to-treat populations . By univariate Cox regression analysis , low baseline soluble protein levels were associated with lower risk of progression/death ( all P < 0.05 ) : in both treatment arms , baseline VEGF-A and IL-8 were associated with overall survival ( OS ) and baseline VEGF-C with progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; in the sunitinib arm , baseline VEGF-A was associated with PFS and baseline sVEGFR-3 with PFS and OS ; in the IFN - arm , baseline IL-8 was associated with PFS . In multivariate analysis , baseline sVEGFR-3 and IL-8 remained independent predictors of OS in the sunitinib arm , while no independent predictors of outcome remained in the IFN - arm . Pharmacodynamic changes were not associated with PFS or OS for any plasma protein investigated . Our findings suggest that , in mRCC , baseline VEGF-A and IL-8 may have prognostic value , while baseline sVEGFR-3 may predict sunitinib efficacy .',\n",

Secondary analysis of data from appropriate-for-gestational age preterm infants in a 28-day randomized clinical trial that evaluated growth , tolerance , and safety of a new ultraconcentrated liquid human milk fortifier ( original study n = 150 ) . This subset of 56 infants had complete growth and nutrition data and met criteria for the original study 's `` efficacy analysis '' ( eg , > 80 % of kilocalorie intake from study diet ) . Nutritional intake was estimated , not actual . Regressions were used to test cumulative kilocalories and protein as the predictors of 28-day change in weight and length z scores ( growth status ) , and to evaluate protein tolerance . Average intake was 118 8 kcal kg ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) and 4.3 0.4 g protein kg ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) , with 16 3 g kg ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) and 1.1 0.2 cm/week growth for 28 days . Cumulative total kilocalories and protein were significant predictors of improved length z score ( P = 0.0054 , 0.0005 ) but not weight z score change . Regression models indicated that protein not kilocalories explained the improvement in length z score , with protein explaining 19 % of the variability . The high protein group averaged 4.6 to 5.5 g kg ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) ( n = 16 ) . Protein tolerance was adequate for all of the study infants based on metabolic measures ( blood urea nitrogen , serum carbon dioxide , pH ) . Higher cumulative protein intake was tolerated and overall lessened the commonly occurring decline in the length but not weight growth status in a 28-day study of preterm infants .\",\n",

MRI scans were performed hourly for 5h , assessing the volume of gastric contents , small bowel water content ( SBWC ) , and colonic gas . Breath hydrogen ( H2 ) was measured and symptoms recorded after each scan . Data are reported as mean ( s.d. ) ( 95 % CI ) when normally distributed and median ( range ) when not . Fructose increased area under the curve ( AUC ) from 0-5h of SBWC to 71 ( 23 ) l/min , significantly greater than for glucose at 36 ( 11-132 ) l/min ( P < 0.001 ) , whereas AUC SBWC after inulin , 33 ( 17-106 ) l/min , was no different from that after glucose . Adding glucose to fructose decreased AUC SBWC to 55 ( 28 ) l/min ( P = 0.08 ) vs. fructose . Inulin substantially increased AUC colonic gas to 33 ( 20 ) l/min , significantly greater than glucose and glucose + fructose ( both P < 0.05 ) . Breath H2 rose more with inulin than with fructose . Glucose when combined with fructose significantly reduced breath H2 by 7,700 ( 3,121-12 ,300 ) p.p.m. / min relative to fructose alone ( P < 0.01 , n = 13 ) .

       " ' While many of the commonly used conservative treatments for knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) have been recognized to be effective , there is still insufficient evidence available . Among the pharmacological treatments for knee OA , oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) act rapidly and are recommended for the management of OA . However , frequent and serious adverse effects of NSAIDs have been recognized . Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid ( IA-HA ) for the treatment of knee OA have been shown to reduce pain and improve joint function . However , there has been no qualified direct comparison study of the efficacy and safety between IA-HA and NSAIDs for patients with knee OA . The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy and safety of early-phase IA-HA in comparison to those of NSAIDs for patients with knee OA . This multicenter , randomized , open-label , parallel-group , non-inferiority comparison study with an oral NSAID involved a total of 200 patients with knee OA . An independent , computer-generated randomization sequence was used to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to NSAIDs three times per day for five weeks ( n = 100 ) or IA-HA once a week for five weeks ( n = 100 ) . The primary endpoint was the percentage change in the patient-oriented outcome measure for knee OA , the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure ( JKOM ) score . All patients were questioned regarding any adverse events during treatment . The full analysis set ( FAS ) was used for analysis . The margin of non-inferiority was 10 % . The analyses of primary endpoint included 98 patients in the IA-HA group and 86 patients in the NSAID group . The difference in the percentage changes of the JKOM score between the two intervention arms ( IA-HA ; -34.7 % ( P < 0.001 ) , NSAID ; -32.2 % ( P < 0.001 ) ) was -2.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : -14.0 to 9.1 ) , indicating IA-HA was not inferior to NSAID . The frequency of both withdrawal and adverse events in the IA-HA group were significantly lower than those in the NSAID group ( P = 0.026 and 0.004 , respectively ) . The early efficacy of IA-HA is suggested to be not inferior to that of NSAIDs , and that the safety of the early phase of IA-HA is superior to that of NSAIDs for patients with knee OA .

Both groups achieved improvements in symptoms with no differences between groups on any primary or secondary outcome measures , diagnostic remission rates or adverse events . The study included several secondary measures that have not been previously validated and treatments were not time matched in terms of number of lessons . These findings indicate that trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy for PTSD with or without exposure components can be safe and efficacious .',\n",
       " ' Patients with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection and cirrhosis have poor response rates after 24 weeks treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin . Treatment for 48 weeks is therefore recommended , although the benefits of this are untested . We examined extended therapy in patients with genotype 3 HCV and advanced fibrosis . Multicentre , open labelled randomized trial comparing therapy with 24 weeks pegylated interferon and ribavirin to 48 weeks of the same therapy . 136 patients completed the study . 67 received 24 weeks therapy and the SVR rate ( 48 % ) did not differ from that seen in the 69 patients who received 48 weeks therapy ( 42 % ) . The response rates in patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis ( 13 patients treated for 24 weeks , 18 patients treated for 48 weeks ) or cirrhosis proven on imaging ( 28 patients treated for 24 weeks and 25 patients treated for 48 weeks ) were 46 % in those treated for 24 weeks and 40 % in those treated for 48 weeks . The differences were not significantly different . Treatment failure was due to relapse in the majority of patients . Patients with genotype 3 HCV and advanced fibrosis do not benefit from extended therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin .',\n",
       " \" Epidemiological research links aggression to low serum concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids , such as those found in fish oil . However , no studies have specifically examined whether fish oil supplementation can reduce the frequency and severity of impulsive aggression in children with disruptive behavior disorders . Children presenting with impulsive aggression and meeting research criteria for diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorders were randomized to receive either : 1 ) Fish oil capsules ( 4g daily ) for 6 weeks followed by placebo ( identical-looking capsules ) for 6 weeks ; or 2 ) placebo for 6 weeks , followed by fish oil for 6 weeks , in a double-blind , crossover design . Primary outcomes were the Children 's Aggression Scale and the Modified Overt Aggression Scale . Secondary outcomes included emotional and behavioral functioning ( Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [ SDQ ] ) , hyperactivity symptoms ( Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ ADHD ] Rating Scale ) , family functioning ( Family Assessment Device ) , and cognitive functioning ( Stop Signal Task , Trail-Making Task , and Eriksen Flanker Task ) . Serum concentrations of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were measured at baseline , and at 6 and 12 weeks . Twenty-one children participated ( 81 % male ; mean age 10.32.2 years ; range 7-14 ) . Fish oil treatment increased serum concentrations of eicosapentanoic acid ( F = 14.76 , p < 0.05 ) and total omega-3s ( F = 20.56 , p < 0.05 ) , but did not influence primary ratings of aggression . In fact , a trend suggested that fish oil worsened a secondary measure of aggression ( SDQ Conduct Subscale , F = 4.34 , p = 0.06 ) . Fish oil treatment was associated with an improvement in one rating of hyperactivity ( SDQ Hyperactivity Subscale , F = 2.22 , p < 0.05 ) , but did not influence any other outcome measures . These findings suggest that fish oil treatment does not improve aggression in children with disruptive behavior disorders .\",\n",
